📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: SIBO & GUT DYSBIOSIS

Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth: bacteria in the wrong place. Up to 80% of IBS patients have SIBO. Different types require different treatments.

Three Types of SIBO:

💨 Hydrogen SIBO
• Most common type
• Bacteria ferment carbs → hydrogen gas
• Causes diarrhea, bloating
• Often responds to rifaximin

🐌 Methane SIBO (now called IMO)
• Archaea produce methane
• Causes constipation, slower transit
• Requires different antibiotics
• Harder to treat

🧪 Hydrogen Sulfide SIBO
• Produces H2S gas (rotten egg smell)
• Diarrhea, fatigue, brain fog
• New testing now available
• May need bismuth-based treatment

Common Symptoms:

• Bloating and gas
• Diarrhea or constipation
• Abdominal pain
• Brain fog and fatigue
• Nutrient deficiencies
• Food intolerances

Testing:

🔬 Lactulose or glucose breath test
🔬 Measures hydrogen, methane, H2S
🔬 Trio-Smart test covers all three gases

Treatment requires identifying the type and addressing underlying causes (motility issues, low stomach acid, structural abnormalities).
