💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: SULFORAPHANE

The most potent natural Nrf2 activator known. Upregulates 200+ protective genes including detox enzymes, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory pathways.

The Nrf2 Pathway:

Nrf2 is the master regulator of cellular defense. Normally kept inactive by Keap1, sulforaphane releases Nrf2 to enter the nucleus and activate the Antioxidant Response Element (ARE).

This upregulates:
→ Glutathione (master antioxidant)
→ Phase II detox enzymes
→ Antioxidant proteins
→ Anti-inflammatory pathways

Effects last 24-72 hours per dose.

Best Sources (glucoraphanin + myrosinase):

🥦 Broccoli sprouts (50-100x more than mature broccoli!)
🥦 Fresh broccoli (raw or lightly steamed)
🥦 Brussels sprouts
🥦 Kale, cabbage, cauliflower

Key Benefits:

🧬 Detoxification enhancement
🛡️ Potent antioxidant induction
🔥 Anti-inflammatory
🦠 Anti-cancer properties
🧠 Neuroprotection
📉 Blood sugar support
🦠 Antimicrobial effects
🧬 Epigenetic modulation (HDAC inhibition)

Dosing Tips:

→ Broccoli sprouts: 1/2 to 1 cup daily
→ Supplements: Look for myrosinase-active formulas
→ Moringa seed extract is an alternative source
→ Heat destroys myrosinase—eat raw or lightly steamed
