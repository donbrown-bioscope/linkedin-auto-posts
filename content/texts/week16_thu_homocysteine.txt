📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: HOMOCYSTEINE & METHYLATION

Homocysteine is a toxic amino acid your body should clear quickly. When methylation is impaired, it accumulates and damages blood vessels and brain.

Homocysteine is produced when methionine (from protein) is metabolized. It should be rapidly converted to either cysteine (via B6) or back to methionine (via B12 and folate).

When these pathways are impaired—often due to MTHFR or other methylation SNPs—homocysteine accumulates.

Homocysteine Levels (μmol/L):

<7 → Optimal
7-10 → Normal
10-15 → Elevated (increased risk)
>15 → High Risk (significantly elevated disease risk)

Conditions Linked to Elevated Homocysteine:

❤️ Heart disease and stroke
🧠 Dementia and cognitive decline
🦴 Osteoporosis
🤰 Pregnancy complications and neural tube defects
🩸 Blood clots (DVT, PE)
😔 Depression
👁️ Macular degeneration

The Methylation Connection:

MTHFR variants (especially C677T homozygous) impair conversion of folate to methylfolate, reducing homocysteine clearance.

Other genes matter too: MTR, MTRR, CBS, BHMT all affect methylation pathways.

Lowering Homocysteine:

✅ Methylfolate (NOT folic acid if MTHFR+)
✅ Methylcobalamin (active B12)
✅ P5P (active B6)
✅ Riboflavin (B2) — often overlooked
✅ Betaine (TMG) — alternative pathway

The Approach:

1. Test homocysteine (simple blood test)
2. If elevated, test MTHFR and consider full methylation panel
3. Supplement with active forms based on genetics
4. Retest in 6-8 weeks to confirm reduction

This is actionable, measurable, precision medicine. Know your level, know your genetics, optimize accordingly.
