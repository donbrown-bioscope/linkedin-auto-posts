📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: NEUROTRANSMITTER TESTING

Mood, focus, sleep, motivation—all driven by brain chemistry. Urinary neurotransmitter testing can reveal imbalances that explain your symptoms.

Major Neurotransmitters:

🔵 Serotonin: Mood, sleep, appetite, pain
Low = depression, anxiety, insomnia, cravings
Precursor: Tryptophan → 5-HTP → Serotonin

🟢 Dopamine: Motivation, reward, focus, pleasure
Low = apathy, fatigue, poor focus, anhedonia
Precursor: Tyrosine → L-DOPA → Dopamine

🟡 Norepinephrine: Alertness, energy, attention
Low = brain fog, fatigue. High = anxiety
Made from dopamine

🔴 Epinephrine: Fight-or-flight, stress response
Chronic elevation = adrenal strain
Made from norepinephrine

🟣 GABA: Calm, relaxation, sleep
Low = anxiety, racing thoughts, insomnia
The brain's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter

⚪ Glutamate: Excitation, learning, memory
High = excitotoxicity, anxiety
Must be in balance with GABA

Testing Considerations:

⚠️ Urinary neurotransmitters reflect peripheral production, not brain levels directly

Best used alongside:
→ Symptom assessment
→ Genetics (COMT, MAO, GAD1, etc.)
→ Organic acids testing
→ Comprehensive health history

Available tests: DUTCH, ZRT, Sanesco, Neuroscience Inc.
