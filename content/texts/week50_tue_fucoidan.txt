💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: FUCOIDAN / SIRT6 ACTIVATORS

The DNA repair amplifier. SIRT6 activation extends lifespan in animal models—fucoidan is a potent natural activator.

What Is SIRT6?

SIRT6 is a sirtuin protein critical for:
→ DNA repair
→ Telomere maintenance
→ Glucose homeostasis

SIRT6 overexpression extends mouse lifespan 15-30%.

Natural activators:
→ Fucoidan (brown seaweed)
→ Cyanidin (berries)

Benefits:

🧬 DNA repair
🔬 Telomere protection
🍬 Glucose control
⏳ Longevity
🔥 Anti-inflammatory
🛡️ Anti-cancer
🫀 Cardioprotective
🦠 Immune support

Dosing:

💊 Fucoidan: 100-400mg daily
💊 Sources: Wakame, kombu, bladderwrack
💊 Best studied: Mekabu, Undaria pinnatifida
💊 Also consider cyanidin (berries, black rice)
💊 Generally well tolerated
