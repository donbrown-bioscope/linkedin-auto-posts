📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: HISTAMINE INTOLERANCE

When you can't break down histamine fast enough. DAO enzyme deficiency causes histamine to accumulate, triggering allergy-like symptoms without actual allergies.

The DAO Connection:

Diamine Oxidase (DAO) breaks down histamine in the gut. Low DAO = histamine accumulates.

Causes of low DAO:
→ Genetics (DAO gene variants)
→ Gut damage (leaky gut, IBD)
→ SIBO
→ Medications (NSAIDs, antidepressants)
→ Alcohol (blocks DAO)

High Histamine Foods to Avoid:

⚠️ Aged cheese
⚠️ Wine and beer
⚠️ Fermented foods (sauerkraut, kimchi)
⚠️ Cured and smoked meats
⚠️ Vinegar
⚠️ Spinach, tomatoes, avocado
⚠️ Leftovers (histamine increases)

Low Histamine Options:

✅ Fresh meat and fish
✅ Eggs
✅ Fresh fruits (except citrus)
✅ Rice, quinoa
✅ Fresh vegetables
✅ Olive oil

Common Symptoms:

Headaches/migraines, flushing, hives, nasal congestion, digestive issues, anxiety, racing heart, fatigue

Treatment includes low-histamine diet, DAO supplements, and addressing underlying gut issues.
