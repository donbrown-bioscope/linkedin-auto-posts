🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: SERPINA1

The protease inhibitor gene. SERPINA1 deficiency causes early-onset emphysema and liver disease—often misdiagnosed for years.

What AAT Does:

Alpha-1 antitrypsin protects lungs from neutrophil elastase damage. Without it, lung tissue is progressively destroyed. The abnormal protein also accumulates in the liver, causing cirrhosis.

Often called "genetic COPD."

Key Variants:

✅ MM (Normal) - 85-90% of population
• Full AAT production
• Normal lung protection
• No liver accumulation

🚨 ZZ (Severe Deficiency) - 1 in 2,500
• 10-15% of normal AAT
• Early emphysema (30s-40s)
• Liver disease risk
• Requires screening

Who Should Be Tested:

→ Early-onset COPD
→ COPD without smoking history
→ Family history of lung/liver disease
→ Unexplained liver disease
→ Panniculitis

Treatment:

💉 IV AAT augmentation therapy available
🚭 Absolutely avoid smoking
