🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: CYP2D6

This single gene metabolizes 25% of all prescription drugs.

Your genetic variant determines whether a standard dose is:
✓ Perfect
✗ Useless  
⚠️ Dangerous

Here's what your CYP2D6 status means:

⚡ Ultra-Rapid Metabolizer (1-10%)
Burns through drugs too fast. Codeine becomes morphine so quickly it can cause overdose. Standard antidepressants may fail.

✓ Extensive/Normal (~70%)
Standard dosing works as expected.

↓ Intermediate (10-15%)
Drugs clear more slowly. May need dose reductions to avoid side effects.

✗ Poor Metabolizer (5-10%)
Drugs accumulate to toxic levels. Codeine provides ZERO pain relief (can't convert to morphine). High risk of adverse reactions.

Drugs affected: Codeine, Tramadol, Tamoxifen, most SSRIs, beta blockers, antipsychotics, ondansetron (Zofran)...

The kicker? Most people have NO IDEA what their status is until something goes wrong.

A $200 pharmacogenomic test could prevent thousands in ER visits and failed treatments.

This is precision medicine at its most practical—matching drug and dose to YOUR genetics.
