📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: GUT PERMEABILITY (LEAKY GUT)

When tight junctions fail, undigested food and bacteria leak into the bloodstream. Intestinal permeability is linked to autoimmunity, inflammation, and chronic disease.

Tight Junction Function:

✅ Healthy Gut Barrier:
Tight junctions (claudins, occludins, zonulin) seal intestinal cells together. Only properly digested nutrients pass through. Immune system stays calm. No systemic inflammation.

⚠️ Increased Permeability:
Tight junctions loosen. LPS (bacterial endotoxin), food antigens, and bacteria enter bloodstream. Immune activation occurs. Systemic inflammation develops. Autoantibodies may form.

Common Causes:

→ Gluten (triggers zonulin release)
→ NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin)
→ Alcohol
→ Dysbiosis (gut bacteria imbalance)
→ Chronic stress
→ Infections
→ Processed foods
→ Pesticides (glyphosate)

Testing Options:

🔬 Zonulin (blood or stool)
🔬 Lactulose/Mannitol ratio
🔬 LPS Antibodies (IgG, IgM, IgA)
🔬 Actomyosin IgA
🔬 Occludin/Zonulin antibodies
🔬 Fecal calprotectin

Repair Strategies:

L-glutamine, zinc carnosine, collagen, bone broth, probiotics, removing triggers, stress management.
