📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: FASTING INSULIN — THE OVERLOOKED BIOMARKER

Your fasting glucose is 95 mg/dL. "Normal."

But your fasting insulin is 15 μIU/mL. That's a problem hiding in plain sight.

The Glucose Trap:

Glucose is the LAST thing to rise in metabolic dysfunction.

Your body fights to keep glucose normal—by pumping out more and more insulin. For years. Sometimes decades.

By the time glucose rises, you've been metabolically unhealthy for a long time.

The Insulin Advantage:

Fasting insulin reveals the EFFORT required to maintain normal glucose.

→ Low insulin + normal glucose = metabolically healthy
→ High insulin + normal glucose = insulin resistance (pre-prediabetes)
→ High insulin + high glucose = frank diabetes

Optimal vs. "Normal":

Lab reference ranges say fasting insulin <25 μIU/mL is "normal."

Optimal is much lower:
→ Ideal: <5-6 μIU/mL
→ Acceptable: <8 μIU/mL
→ Concerning: >10 μIU/mL
→ Insulin resistant: >15 μIU/mL

HOMA-IR: The Combined Metric

HOMA-IR = (Fasting Glucose × Fasting Insulin) / 405

→ Optimal: <1.0
→ Acceptable: <1.5
→ Insulin resistant: >2.0

Why This Matters:

Insulin resistance is linked to:
→ Heart disease
→ Cancer
→ Alzheimer's (now called "Type 3 diabetes")
→ Fatty liver
→ PCOS

Catching it early—via fasting insulin—means you can reverse it with lifestyle BEFORE disease develops.

The Action Step:

Request fasting insulin on your next blood work. It costs ~$10-20. If it's elevated, you have years to fix it.
