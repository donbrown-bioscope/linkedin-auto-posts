💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: RESVERATROL & PTEROSTILBENE

The "red wine molecule" that activates sirtuins—your longevity genes. Pterostilbene is its more bioavailable cousin. Together, they mimic caloric restriction.

Both are stilbenes that activate SIRT1, the same pathway triggered by fasting and caloric restriction.

Resveratrol vs. Pterostilbene:

🍷 Resveratrol:
→ Source: Red wine, grapes
→ Bioavailability: ~20%
→ Half-life: 1-3 hours
→ Dose: 250-500mg/day
→ More research, lower absorption

🫐 Pterostilbene:
→ Source: Blueberries
→ Bioavailability: ~80%
→ Half-life: 7+ hours
→ Dose: 50-150mg/day
→ 4x better absorption, longer acting

Mechanisms:

🧬 SIRT1 activation (longevity pathway)
⚡ AMPK activation (metabolic master switch)
🔥 Anti-inflammatory (NF-κB inhibition)
🛡️ Antioxidant (direct radical scavenging)
🔋 Mitochondrial biogenesis
❤️ Cardiovascular protection
🧠 Neuroprotection
📉 Blood sugar regulation

Practical Considerations:

→ Take with fat for better absorption
→ Trans-resveratrol is the active form
→ Combining both may be synergistic
→ Some take with quercetin (senolytic combo)
→ Quality matters — many products are underdosed

The question isn't whether to use resveratrol—it's which form, and how much.
