💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: PEPTIDE BIOREGULATORS (KHAVINSON)

Russian longevity science. Short peptides (2-4 amino acids) that regulate gene expression in specific tissues. 40+ years of research, used by Soviet military.

How Bioregulators Work:

Developed by Prof. Vladimir Khavinson. These short peptides interact with DNA, modulating gene expression in target tissues.

They restore youthful function by "resetting" age-related epigenetic changes.

Oral administration despite being peptides (small enough to absorb).

Key Bioregulators:

🧬 Epithalamin/Epithalon - Pineal, telomerase, melatonin
🛡️ Thymalin - Thymus, immune system
🧠 Cortexin - Brain cortex, cognition
👁️ Retinalamin - Retina, vision
❤️ Cardiogen - Heart, cardiovascular
🫀 Livagen - Liver, detoxification

Protocol:

💊 Typically 10-20 day courses
💊 1-2 capsules daily
💊 Cycle 2-3 times per year
💊 Brands: Nanopep, Peptide Bioregulator

Limited Western availability.
