📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: CIRCADIAN RHYTHM & METABOLISM

The same meal eaten at 8am vs 8pm has different metabolic effects. Your body clock controls insulin, cortisol, repair—everything.

Your circadian rhythm isn't just about sleep. It's a master controller of virtually every biological process.

Your 24-Hour Metabolic Clock:

🌅 6-9 AM
Cortisol peaks (wake signal), insulin sensitivity highest, best time to eat carbs

☀️ 12-3 PM
Peak alertness and cognitive function, best time for exercise

🌆 6-9 PM
Insulin resistance rising, melatonin beginning, eating now hits differently

🌙 11 PM-3 AM
Deep repair mode, growth hormone pulses, autophagy peaks, DNA repair

Circadian Disruption Consequences:

When you fight your clock—shift work, late eating, light at night, irregular sleep—every system suffers:

↑ Diabetes risk
↑ Obesity
↑ Heart disease
↑ Cancer risk
↓ Immune function
↓ Cognitive performance
↓ Mood regulation
↓ Longevity

WHO classified shift work as a "probable carcinogen" based on this evidence.

Circadian Optimization Strategies:

✅ Morning sunlight (10+ min) — Sets your master clock
✅ Consistent wake time — Even weekends
✅ Eating window ≤12 hours — Time-restricted eating
✅ No food 3 hours before bed — Insulin should be low for sleep
✅ Dim lights after sunset — Protect melatonin
✅ Cool bedroom (65-68°F) — Temperature drops signal sleep

The insight: WHEN you do things matters as much as WHAT you do.
