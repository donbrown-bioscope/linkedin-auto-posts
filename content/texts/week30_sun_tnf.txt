🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: TNF

The "alarm" cytokine. TNF triggers inflammation, immune response, and cell death. Too much TNF drives autoimmune disease—TNF blockers are billion-dollar drugs.

TNF-alpha (Tumor Necrosis Factor) is released by immune cells in response to infection, injury, or stress. It:

→ Activates inflammation
→ Recruits immune cells
→ Can trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis)

Diseases Driven by Excess TNF:

• Rheumatoid Arthritis
• Crohn's Disease
• Psoriasis
• Ankylosing Spondylitis
• Ulcerative Colitis
• Heart Failure
• Depression
• Insulin Resistance

Key Genetic Variant:

TNF -308G>A polymorphism:
→ A allele = higher TNF production
→ Increased autoimmune disease risk
→ Important for biologic therapy selection

TNF Inhibitor Drugs:

These are among the most prescribed biologics:
💊 Humira (adalimumab)
💊 Remicade (infliximab)
💊 Enbrel (etanercept)
💊 Simponi (golimumab)

Pharmacogenomics can help predict which patients will respond best to TNF inhibitors.
