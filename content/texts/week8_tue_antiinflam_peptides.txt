💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PEPTIDES
🧬 Peptide Series

Chronic inflammation is the common denominator of aging and disease.

Heart disease. Diabetes. Alzheimer's. Cancer. Autoimmunity.

All connected by persistent, low-grade inflammation—what scientists call "inflammaging."

The traditional approach? NSAIDs and steroids.

The problem:
→ Broad suppression = impaired healing
→ Long-term use = serious side effects
→ Stomach ulcers, kidney damage, bone loss
→ Doesn't address root cause

The peptide approach: MODULATION, not suppression.

🛡️ THYMOSIN ALPHA-1

The thymus gland shrinks with age—and with it, immune regulation declines.

Thymosin Alpha-1 restores what's lost:
→ Rebalances Th1/Th2 immune response
→ Enhances T-cell and NK cell function
→ FDA-approved in 30+ countries (not US)
→ 40+ years of safety data

🔥 KPV

A tripeptide derived from alpha-MSH:
→ Potent NF-κB inhibition (master inflammation switch)
→ Reduces TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β
→ Gut healing and microbiome support
→ Antimicrobial properties

The key difference:

NSAIDs/Steroids → Block the whole inflammatory pathway
Peptides → Restore balance to a dysregulated system

It's the difference between turning off the fire alarm vs. actually putting out the fire.
