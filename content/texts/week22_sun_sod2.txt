🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: SOD2

Your mitochondria's first line of defense against oxidative damage. SOD2 converts deadly superoxide into hydrogen peroxide. Variants affect your antioxidant capacity.

SOD2 (Superoxide Dismutase 2) is a manganese-dependent enzyme located in mitochondria. It's essential for neutralizing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during energy generation.

SOD2 Function:

1️⃣ Mitochondria produce energy (ATP)
2️⃣ This generates superoxide radicals (O₂⁻)
3️⃣ SOD2 converts superoxide to H₂O₂
4️⃣ Catalase/GPx convert H₂O₂ to water
5️⃣ System is protected

The Ala16Val Variant (rs4880):

🔵 Ala/Ala (CC): Efficient mitochondrial import, full activity. Better baseline protection. May produce excess H₂O₂ if downstream enzymes are limited.

🟡 Ala/Val (CT): Intermediate activity. Most common genotype.

🔴 Val/Val (TT): 30-40% slower import into mitochondria, reduced activity. Higher oxidative stress burden. Increased need for antioxidant support.

Clinical Implications:

Val/Val individuals should consider:
→ Higher antioxidant intake
→ MnSOD cofactors (manganese)
→ Mitochondrial support (CoQ10, PQQ)
→ Avoiding excessive pro-oxidant stressors
→ Supporting downstream enzymes (catalase, GPx)

Know your SOD2 status to personalize your antioxidant strategy.
