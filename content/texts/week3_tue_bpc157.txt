💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: TISSUE REPAIR PEPTIDES
🧬 Peptide Series

Your body heals slowly after 40. These peptides may change that.

BPC-157, TB-500, and GHK-Cu represent a new frontier in regenerative medicine—signaling molecules that accelerate tissue repair.

🔧 BPC-157 (Body Protection Compound)

A 15-amino acid peptide derived from gastric juice:
→ Accelerates tendon, ligament, and muscle healing
→ Protects and heals the gut lining
→ Promotes angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation)
→ Shown to heal "unhealable" injuries in studies
→ Works systemically even when injected locally

🔄 TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4)

A 43-amino acid peptide naturally found in all cells:
→ Promotes cell migration to injury sites
→ Reduces inflammation and scar tissue
→ Supports cardiac tissue repair
→ Enhances flexibility and reduces adhesions
→ Popular in sports medicine

✨ GHK-Cu (Copper Peptide)

A tripeptide bound to copper:
→ Stimulates collagen synthesis
→ Promotes wound healing and skin repair
→ Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
→ Used topically for skin aging
→ Injectable for systemic effects

The Synergy:

Many practitioners combine these for comprehensive tissue repair:
→ BPC-157 for gut and connective tissue
→ TB-500 for muscle and cardiac
→ GHK-Cu for skin and systemic rejuvenation

Not FDA-approved for human use, but widely used in regenerative medicine clinics. The research is compelling; the anecdotes are remarkable.
