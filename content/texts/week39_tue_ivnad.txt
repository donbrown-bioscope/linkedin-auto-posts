💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: IV NAD+

Bypassing oral absorption. IV NAD+ delivers this critical coenzyme directly to your bloodstream, rapidly replenishing cellular NAD+ levels.

Why IV vs Oral?

→ Oral NAD+ is largely degraded in the gut
→ Oral precursors (NMN, NR) must be converted
→ IV delivers NAD+ directly
→ Achieves blood levels not possible orally

Key Benefits:

🔋 Energy/ATP production
🧠 Cognitive clarity
🧬 DNA repair (PARP activation)
🔄 Sirtuin activation
🍺 Addiction recovery
😴 Chronic fatigue
🧓 Anti-aging
