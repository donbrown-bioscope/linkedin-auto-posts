🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: ACE

The blood pressure gene with athletic implications. ACE I/D polymorphism predicts endurance vs power performance and cardiovascular drug response.

ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme) regulates blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin system. The I/D polymorphism has dual relevance:

II Genotype (Insertion):

🏃 Lower ACE activity
🏃 Better endurance performance
🏃 Efficient oxygen utilization
🏃 Elite marathon runners overrepresented
🏃 Mountaineers, rowers
🏃 Lower blood pressure baseline

DD Genotype (Deletion):

💪 Higher ACE activity
💪 Better power/strength performance
💪 Sprint performance advantage
💪 Greater muscle hypertrophy potential
💪 Higher blood pressure risk
💪 May benefit most from ACE inhibitors

Pharmacogenomic Relevance:

ACE inhibitors (lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril) are first-line hypertension drugs. DD genotype individuals often have:
→ The highest baseline ACE activity
→ The most benefit from ACE inhibitors
→ Better blood pressure response

Know your genotype to optimize both athletic training and medication selection.
