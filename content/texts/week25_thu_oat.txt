📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: ORGANIC ACIDS TESTING (OAT)

A single urine test that reveals cellular metabolism, gut health, neurotransmitters, and nutrient status. The most comprehensive functional medicine test available.

What OAT Measures:

🔋 Mitochondrial Function
Citric acid cycle intermediates, fatty acid oxidation markers. Reveals energy production efficiency and CoQ10 need.

🦠 Gut Dysbiosis
Yeast/fungal overgrowth (arabinose), bacterial overgrowth (HPHPA, hippuric acid), Clostridia markers.

🧠 Neurotransmitter Metabolites
HVA (dopamine), VMA (norepinephrine), 5-HIAA (serotonin), quinolinic acid (neuroinflammation).

🧬 Methylation & Detox
Methylmalonic acid (B12), formiminoglutamic acid (folate), pyroglutamic acid (glutathione status).

🛡️ Oxidative Stress
8-OHdG, lipid peroxides. Direct measure of cellular oxidative damage.

💊 Nutrient Markers
B vitamins, vitamin C, CoQ10, carnitine functional status—not just blood levels.
