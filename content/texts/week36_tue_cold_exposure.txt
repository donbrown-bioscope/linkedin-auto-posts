💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: COLD EXPOSURE PROTOCOLS

Controlled stress that makes you stronger. Cold exposure activates brown fat, boosts dopamine 250%, and triggers cold shock proteins for longevity and resilience.

The Science of Cold:

→ Activates brown adipose tissue (BAT)
→ BAT burns glucose and fat for heat
→ Releases norepinephrine (focus, mood)
→ Dopamine increases 250%, lasting hours
→ Cold shock proteins (RBM3) are neuroprotective
→ Improves metabolic health and insulin sensitivity

Key Benefits:

🔥 Brown fat activation (metabolism)
🧠 Dopamine boost (mood, motivation)
💪 Enhanced recovery
📉 Reduced inflammation
🩸 Improved metabolism
😌 Stress resilience
🛡️ Immune function
⚡ Increased energy

Protocols:

❄️ Cold Shower
End with 30-90 seconds cold

❄️ Ice Bath
50-59°F (10-15°C) for 1-5 minutes
2-3x per week

❄️ Huberman Protocol
11 minutes total cold exposure per week
Divided across sessions

Start gradually. Note: Avoid immediately post-workout if muscle hypertrophy is the primary goal (blunts adaptation).
