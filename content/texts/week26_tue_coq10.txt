💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: COQ10 / UBIQUINOL

Essential for every cell's energy production. Levels drop 50% by age 50. Statins deplete CoQ10—supplementation is often critical.

CoQ10 is a key component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It's essential for ATP production and also functions as a potent antioxidant.

Two Forms—Which to Choose?

🟡 Ubiquinone (Oxidized):
• Traditional CoQ10 form
• Must be converted to ubiquinol to use
• Less expensive
• Good for younger, healthy people
• 100-200mg typical dose

🟢 Ubiquinol (Reduced):
• Active, ready-to-use form
• 3-8x better absorbed
• Best for: age 40+, statin users
• NQO1 null genotypes NEED this form
• 100-200mg typical dose

Key Benefits:

❤️ Heart function and heart failure
⚡ Energy production (every cell)
🧠 Brain health and neuroprotection
💪 Muscle function
🩸 Blood pressure support
🛡️ Powerful antioxidant
🏃 Exercise capacity
💊 Offsets statin side effects

Critical Point:

ALL statin users should supplement CoQ10. Statins block the same pathway that produces CoQ10. Deficiency causes muscle pain, fatigue, and weakness.
