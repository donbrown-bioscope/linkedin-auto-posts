💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: MITOCHONDRIAL PEPTIDES
🧬 Peptide Series

Your mitochondria decline 10% per decade. These peptides target the inner membrane—restoring the powerhouses that power everything.

Mitochondrial dysfunction underlies nearly every age-related disease: heart failure, neurodegeneration, diabetes, sarcopenia, cancer. If you could fix one thing, it would be this.

⚡ SS-31 (Elamipretide)

A cardiolipin-targeting tetrapeptide:
→ Binds cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane
→ Optimizes electron transport chain efficiency
→ Reduces ROS production at the source (not just scavenging after)
→ Currently in Phase 3 trials for heart failure
→ Reverses age-related mitochondrial decline in animal studies

Think of SS-31 as lubricant for your cellular engines—it doesn't add more fuel, it makes the engine run smoother.

🔋 MOTS-c

A mitochondrial-derived peptide (encoded in mtDNA):
→ Your own mitochondria make this peptide
→ Production declines with age
→ Improves insulin sensitivity
→ Enhances exercise capacity
→ Activates AMPK (the metabolic master switch)
→ May prevent age-related metabolic dysfunction

MOTS-c is essentially replacing what your aging mitochondria stop making.

The Insight:

These peptides work where the damage starts—the inner mitochondrial membrane. This is upstream of everything else. Fix mitochondria, and you fix energy, you fix oxidative stress, you fix cellular signaling.
