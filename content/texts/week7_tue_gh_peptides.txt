💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: GH SECRETAGOGUES
🧬 Peptide Series

Growth hormone declines 14% per decade after age 30.

By 60, you may have 20% of the GH you had at 20.

This contributes to: muscle loss, fat gain, thin skin, reduced bone density, decreased energy.

The traditional solution? Inject synthetic HGH.

The problem with synthetic HGH:
→ Supraphysiologic levels
→ Constant exposure (not pulsatile)
→ Suppresses your own production
→ Higher side effect risk
→ Expensive ($1000+/month)

The peptide alternative:

📈 CJC-1295 (with DAC)
A GHRH analog that stimulates your pituitary to release more GH:
→ Sustained elevation lasting days
→ Preserves natural pulsatile pattern
→ Once or twice weekly dosing
→ Your body, your GH

⚡ Ipamorelin
A selective ghrelin receptor agonist:
→ Triggers acute GH pulses
→ NO increase in cortisol (unlike other secretagogues)
→ NO increase in prolactin
→ Best safety profile in its class

The synergy:

CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin together mimic youthful GH secretion patterns:
→ CJC provides sustained baseline elevation
→ Ipamorelin provides the spikes
→ Together they restore what aging diminishes

Expected benefits:
💪 Improved lean body mass
🔥 Enhanced fat loss (especially visceral)
😴 Deeper sleep
🔧 Better recovery

This is hormone optimization, not replacement.
