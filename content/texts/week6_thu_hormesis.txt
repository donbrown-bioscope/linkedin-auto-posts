📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: HORMESIS

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

It's not just a saying—it's a biological principle called hormesis.

Low doses of stress trigger adaptive responses that leave you more resilient than before.

The dose-response curve:

📉 None → Baseline function
📈 Low → ENHANCED function (the sweet spot)
📊 Moderate → Still beneficial
📉 High → Stress overwhelms adaptation
💀 Extreme → Damage

The key insight: Comfort is not optimization.

Your body evolved to handle stress. Remove all stress and systems atrophy. Apply the right amount and they strengthen.

Hormetic stressors and their benefits:

🥶 Cold exposure
→ Brown fat activation, norepinephrine surge (3-5x), improved mood

🔥 Heat/Sauna
→ Heat shock proteins, growth hormone boost (up to 16x), cardiovascular conditioning

🍽️ Fasting
→ Autophagy activation, ketone production, insulin sensitivity reset

🏋️ Exercise
→ Mitochondrial biogenesis, BDNF for brain health, muscle adaptation

🌿 Phytochemicals (sulforaphane, curcumin)
→ Nrf2 pathway activation, antioxidant enzyme upregulation

The personalization piece:

What's hormetic for a 25-year-old athlete might be harmful for a 70-year-old with heart disease.

The dose must match your current capacity. Start low, recover fully, then increase.

Strategic stress, followed by recovery. That's the formula.
