📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: ApoB — THE BETTER CHOLESTEROL METRIC

Your LDL-C is "fine." But you might still be at high cardiovascular risk.

Here's why ApoB is the metric that matters.

The Problem with LDL-C:

LDL-C measures the cholesterol INSIDE LDL particles.

But cardiovascular risk comes from the NUMBER of particles entering your artery walls—not how much cholesterol each one carries.

You can have:
→ "Normal" LDL-C with MANY small particles (high risk)
→ "High" LDL-C with FEW large particles (lower risk)

LDL-C misses this distinction. ApoB doesn't.

What is ApoB?

Every atherogenic particle—LDL, VLDL, IDL, Lp(a)—has exactly ONE ApoB molecule.

ApoB = direct count of particles that cause atherosclerosis.

It's that simple.

The Numbers:

Population average: ~100 mg/dL
Optimal: <80 mg/dL
Aggressive prevention: <60 mg/dL
Highest risk patients: <40 mg/dL (achievable with modern therapy)

Why Isn't Everyone Measuring This?

Inertia. LDL-C has been the standard for decades.

But major guidelines now recognize ApoB as superior:
→ European Society of Cardiology: ApoB recommended
→ Canadian guidelines: ApoB preferred over LDL-C
→ Peter Attia, lipidologists: ApoB is the target

The Action Step:

Ask for ApoB on your next lipid panel. It's inexpensive and widely available. If your ApoB is elevated despite "normal" LDL-C, you have residual risk that needs addressing.
