📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: CV IMAGING BEYOND CAC

CAC is just the beginning. Modern cardiovascular imaging can detect soft plaque, arterial stiffness, and functional abnormalities years before events occur.

Advanced CV Imaging Options:

🫀 CCTA (CT Angiography)
Visualizes coronary arteries with contrast. Detects soft (vulnerable) plaque that CAC misses.

🔊 Carotid IMT
Ultrasound measures artery wall thickness. Early atherosclerosis marker.

📈 Pulse Wave Velocity
Measures arterial stiffness. "Vascular age" assessment.

🩺 Echocardiogram
Heart structure and function. Valve issues, wall motion, ejection fraction.

🏃 Stress Testing
Exercise or pharmacologic stress. Detects ischemia under load.

🧲 Cardiac MRI
Most detailed heart imaging. Detects scar, inflammation, infiltrative disease.

Suggested Progression:

1️⃣ Start with CAC score
2️⃣ If elevated → Consider CCTA for soft plaque
3️⃣ Add carotid IMT and PWV for comprehensive vascular assessment
4️⃣ Stress testing if symptoms or high risk
