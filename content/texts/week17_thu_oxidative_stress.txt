📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: OXIDATIVE STRESS

Free radicals aren't all bad—they're signaling molecules. The problem is imbalance: when production overwhelms your antioxidant defenses.

Oxidative stress occurs when reactive oxygen species (ROS) exceed your body's capacity to neutralize them. This damages DNA, proteins, and lipids.

The Oxidative Balance:

🔥 Pro-Oxidant Sources:
→ Mitochondrial respiration (normal metabolism)
→ Inflammation
→ Environmental toxins
→ UV radiation
→ Heavy metals
→ Processed foods

🛡️ Antioxidant Defenses:
→ Glutathione (master antioxidant)
→ SOD, Catalase, GPx (enzymes)
→ Vitamin C, E
→ Polyphenols
→ Nrf2 pathway activation
→ Uric acid

How to Measure Oxidative Stress:

🔬 8-OHdG — DNA damage marker
🔬 F2-Isoprostanes — Lipid peroxidation (gold standard)
🔬 MDA (Malondialdehyde) — Lipid damage
🔬 Glutathione ratio (GSH:GSSG)
🔬 Total Antioxidant Capacity
🔬 CoQ10 levels
🔬 Protein carbonyls

The Paradox:

Some oxidative stress is necessary. Exercise creates ROS, which signal adaptation. Too many antioxidant supplements can blunt these benefits.

The goal isn't eliminating oxidation—it's maintaining balance. Test, don't guess.
