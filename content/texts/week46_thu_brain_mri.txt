📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: BRAIN MRI & VOLUMETRICS

See your brain age. Volumetric MRI measures brain region sizes and detects atrophy years before symptoms—enabling early intervention.

What Is Volumetric Brain MRI?

Advanced MRI analysis that measures the volume of specific brain regions.

AI compares your brain to age-matched norms.

Detects early shrinkage in:
→ Hippocampus (memory)
→ Frontal lobe (executive function)
→ White matter (brain wiring)

Establishes baseline for tracking brain aging.

Key Brain Regions:

🧠 Hippocampus - Memory center (early atrophy in Alzheimer's)
🧠 Frontal Lobe - Executive function, personality
🧠 White Matter - Brain wiring, vascular damage
🧠 Temporal Lobe - Language, emotion
🧠 Cerebellum - Coordination, balance
🧠 Total Brain Volume - Overall vs peers

Services & Cost:

→ Prenuvo
→ Ezra
→ NeuroQuant (add-on to standard MRI)
→ Cost: $300-2500
→ Track every 1-2 years

Actionable: Optimize sleep, exercise, metabolic health, reduce inflammation.
