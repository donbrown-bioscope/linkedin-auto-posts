💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: OZONE THERAPY

A controlled oxidative stress that triggers massive antioxidant upregulation. The paradox: brief pro-oxidant exposure makes you more anti-oxidant.

Ozone (O3) is a highly reactive form of oxygen. In therapy, controlled doses create a hormetic stress that activates your body's defense systems.

Delivery Methods:

🩸 MAH (Major Autohemotherapy)
Blood is drawn, mixed with ozone, and reinfused. Most common systemic approach. 30-60 minutes per session.

🩸 10-Pass / High-Dose Ozone
Multiple passes of blood through ozonation. Intensified protocol for more serious conditions.

💨 Rectal Insufflation
Ozone gas absorbed through colon mucosa. Non-invasive way to get systemic effects at home.

💧 Ozonated Water/Oil
Topical or oral applications. Great for gut health and wound healing.

The Mechanism (Hormesis):

Ozone creates brief oxidative stress →
Activates Nrf2 pathway →
Upregulates glutathione, SOD, catalase →
Net result: INCREASED antioxidant capacity

Benefits Reported:

🛡️ Immune modulation (both stimulating and regulating)
🔋 Improved mitochondrial function
🩸 Enhanced circulation and oxygen delivery
🦠 Antimicrobial effects (bacteria, viruses, fungi)
🔥 Reduced inflammation

Clinical Uses:

→ Chronic infections (Lyme, viral)
→ Autoimmune conditions
→ Wound healing
→ Athletic performance/recovery
→ General wellness and longevity

Not FDA-approved in the US, but widely used in Europe and Latin America with good safety records.
