💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)

The only compound proven to create new mitochondria. PQQ activates PGC-1α, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis.

What Makes PQQ Unique:

Most supplements support existing mitochondria. PQQ actually triggers the creation of NEW mitochondria through PGC-1α and CREB signaling.

It's also an incredibly potent antioxidant—5,000x more efficient at redox cycling than vitamin C.

Key Benefits:

🔋 Mitochondrial biogenesis (new mitochondria)
🧠 Cognitive function and memory
❤️ Heart health
😴 Sleep quality improvement
🛡️ Neuroprotection
⚡ Energy levels
🔥 Anti-inflammatory effects
🧬 NGF (nerve growth factor) production

Best Synergy:

PQQ + CoQ10 together = Complete mitochondrial optimization

PQQ creates new mitochondria. CoQ10 supports their function. Together they're more effective than either alone.

Dosing:

→ 10-20mg daily typical dose
→ Food sources: Natto, parsley, green peppers, kiwi
→ Well-tolerated with excellent safety profile
→ Effects may take 2-4 weeks to notice

The only way to grow more cellular power plants.
