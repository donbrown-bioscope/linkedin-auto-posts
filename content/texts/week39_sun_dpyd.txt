🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: DPYD

A potentially fatal pharmacogenomic interaction. DPYD deficiency can cause severe, life-threatening toxicity from common chemotherapy drugs.

⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING:

3-5% of population has partial DPYD deficiency
0.1% have complete deficiency

Standard doses of 5-FU or capecitabine can cause DEATH in deficient patients.

European guidelines now REQUIRE DPYD testing before fluoropyrimidine therapy.

DPYD Activity Levels:

Normal Metabolizer:
✅ Full enzyme activity
✅ Standard dosing OK
✅ Normal toxicity risk

Intermediate (3-5%):
⚠️ 25-50% dose reduction needed
⚠️ Increased toxicity risk
⚠️ Severe mucositis, diarrhea possible

Poor Metabolizer (0.1%):
🚫 AVOID fluoropyrimidines
🚫 Life-threatening toxicity
🚫 Neutropenia, sepsis, death risk

Affected Drugs:

💊 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)
💊 Capecitabine (Xeloda)
💊 Tegafur

Used for colorectal, breast, head/neck cancers.

Test BEFORE prescribing. This is actionable pharmacogenomics.
