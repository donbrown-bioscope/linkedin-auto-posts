📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: DEXA BODY COMPOSITION

Beyond the scale. DEXA reveals fat mass, lean mass, bone density, and visceral fat—the metrics that actually predict health outcomes.

What Is DEXA?

Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry uses two X-ray beams to measure tissue density.

Originally for bone density, now gold standard for body composition.

Low radiation (< 1 chest X-ray).

Key Metrics:

📊 Body Fat % - More accurate than BMI
💪 Lean Mass - Critical for longevity
🔥 Visceral Fat - Metabolic disease predictor
🦴 Bone Density - Osteoporosis screening
📐 Android/Gynoid Ratio - CV risk indicator
💪 ALMI - Sarcopenia screening

Optimal Ranges:

Body fat:
→ Men: 10-20%
→ Women: 18-28%

Why Track Over Time:

Annual DEXA reveals if you're:
→ Gaining muscle/losing fat (good)
→ Losing muscle/gaining fat (bad)

Even if weight stays same!

Cost: $75-200
