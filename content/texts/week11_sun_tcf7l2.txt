🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: TCF7L2

The strongest common genetic risk factor for Type 2 diabetes. 30% of people carry the risk variant—and can prevent the disease if they know.

TCF7L2 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 2) affects how your pancreas responds to meals, particularly through incretin hormones like GLP-1.

Risk by Genotype (rs7903146):

C/C → 1x (Baseline risk)
C/T → 1.4x (40% increased risk)
T/T → 2x (Double the risk)

The T allele is remarkably common—about 30% of people carry at least one copy.

How TCF7L2 Causes Diabetes:

The risk variant impairs:
→ Insulin secretion from beta cells
→ GLP-1 signaling (the incretin effect)
→ First-phase insulin response to meals

Result: Glucose stays elevated longer after eating. Over years, this leads to insulin resistance and eventually diabetes.

The Prevention Opportunity:

Here's the remarkable finding from the Diabetes Prevention Program:

T/T carriers (highest genetic risk) who exercised and lost weight reduced their diabetes risk by 70%—MORE than non-carriers benefited from the same intervention.

Those with the highest genetic risk respond BEST to lifestyle intervention.

This is precision prevention: identify who's at risk, target them with interventions that work especially well for their genotype.

If you have TCF7L2 risk variants, you're not destined for diabetes—you're just more sensitive to carbohydrates and more rewarded for exercise.
