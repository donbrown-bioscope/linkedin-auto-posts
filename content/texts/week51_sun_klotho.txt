🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: KLOTHO

The longevity gene. KLOTHO overexpression extends lifespan 20-30% in mice—and the KL-VS variant boosts cognition in humans.

What Klotho Does:

Klotho is an anti-aging protein primarily expressed in kidneys and brain.

It suppresses:
→ Insulin/IGF-1 signaling
→ Oxidative stress
→ Age-related diseases

Soluble Klotho circulates in blood and declines with age.

The KL-VS variant increases Klotho levels and is associated with better cognition and longevity.

Benefits:

⏳ Longevity
🧠 Cognition
🫀 Heart health
🦴 Bone health
🧬 Anti-cancer
💧 Kidney protection
🔥 Anti-inflammatory
🛡️ Antioxidant

How to Boost Klotho:

🔬 Exercise (especially aerobic)
🔬 Vitamin D
🔬 PPAR-γ agonists
🔬 Reducing phosphate intake
🔬 Can test soluble Klotho levels
🔬 Research ongoing into Klotho therapies
