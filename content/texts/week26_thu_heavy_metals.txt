📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: HEAVY METAL TESTING

Chronic low-level exposure accumulates over decades. Mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium—they disrupt hormones, damage neurons, and accelerate aging.

Major Toxic Metals:

☠️ Lead (Pb)
Old paint, pipes, contaminated soil, ceramics. Damages brain, kidneys, cardiovascular system. No safe level.

☠️ Mercury (Hg)
Fish (especially large predator fish), dental amalgams, some vaccines. Neurotoxic, disrupts thyroid.

☠️ Arsenic (As)
Rice, well water, poultry, apple juice. Carcinogenic, increases diabetes risk.

☠️ Cadmium (Cd)
Cigarettes, shellfish, chocolate, batteries. Kidney damage, bone loss.

☠️ Aluminum (Al)
Cookware, antacids, deodorants, vaccines. Linked to neurodegeneration.

☠️ Thallium (Tl)
Coal plants, electronics, some foods. Hair loss, neuropathy.

Testing Methods:

🔬 Blood: Measures recent/acute exposure
🔬 Urine (unprovoked): Baseline excretion
🔬 Urine (provoked): Body burden (with chelator)
🔬 Hair: Long-term exposure pattern
🔬 RBC metals: Intracellular levels

Provoked urine testing (with DMSA, DMPS, or EDTA) reveals total body burden that blood tests miss.
