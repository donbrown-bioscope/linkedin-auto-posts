🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: SLCO1B1

30 million Americans take statins. 15-20% of them carry a variant that makes muscle pain and weakness far more likely.

SLCO1B1 encodes a transporter that moves statins from blood into the liver, where they work. If this transporter is impaired, statins accumulate in muscle tissue instead—causing myopathy.

Myopathy Risk by Genotype (rs4149056):

T/T → 1x (Normal function)
T/C → 4.5x increased risk (Intermediate function)
C/C → 17x increased risk (Poor function)

The C allele is common—about 15-20% of people carry at least one copy.

Why This Matters:

Statin myopathy ranges from:
→ Mild muscle aches (most common)
→ Significant weakness
→ Rhabdomyolysis (rare but dangerous)

Many patients stop statins due to muscle symptoms—even when they desperately need cardiovascular protection.

But the solution isn't "no statin"—it's the RIGHT statin at the RIGHT dose.

Affected Statins (High to Low Risk):

🔴 Simvastatin — Highest myopathy risk
🟠 Atorvastatin — Moderate risk
🟡 Rosuvastatin — Lower risk
🟢 Pravastatin — Lowest risk (doesn't use SLCO1B1)

CPIC Guidelines:

For C/C carriers:
→ Avoid simvastatin >20mg
→ Consider pravastatin or rosuvastatin
→ Start at reduced doses
→ Monitor CK levels

A $200 pharmacogenomic test could prevent years of "statin intolerance" and keep patients on life-saving therapy.
