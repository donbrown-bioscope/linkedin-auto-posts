💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: RAPAMYCIN

The most robust longevity drug ever discovered—and it's already FDA-approved.

Rapamycin extends lifespan in every organism tested: yeast, worms, flies, mice. In mice, it works even when started late in life.

How It Works:

Rapamycin inhibits mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin)—a nutrient-sensing pathway that controls:

→ Cell growth and proliferation
→ Autophagy (cellular cleanup)
→ Protein synthesis
→ Metabolism

When mTOR is chronically activated (by constant eating, high protein, sedentary lifestyle), aging accelerates.

Rapamycin mimics some effects of caloric restriction—without the restriction.

The Evidence:

🐭 Mice: 9-14% lifespan extension, even starting at "old age"
🐕 Dogs: TRIAD study showing improved cardiac function
👥 Humans: Improved immune function in elderly (counterintuitive!)
🧬 Multiple anti-aging pathways activated

The Longevity Protocol:

Many longevity physicians use LOW-DOSE, INTERMITTENT rapamycin:
→ 5-6mg once weekly (not daily immunosuppressive dosing)
→ Allows mTOR to cycle (inhibition → recovery)
→ Reduces side effects while maintaining benefits

What Practitioners Report:

✓ Improved immune function (fewer colds)
✓ Better skin quality
✓ Enhanced autophagy
✓ Potential senolytic effects

The Risks:

At high continuous doses: immunosuppression, glucose intolerance, lipid changes.

At low intermittent doses: appears well-tolerated, but long-term human data is limited.

This is frontier medicine. But rapamycin may be the closest thing we have to a true anti-aging drug.
