📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: DNA REPAIR CAPACITY

Your DNA sustains 100,000+ damaging events every single day.

Oxidation. Radiation. Replication errors. Chemical damage.

Yet you wake up fine (most days).

Why? Because you have an army of repair systems working 24/7.

The daily assault on your genome:

⚡ 100,000+ DNA lesions per cell per day
✂️ 50 double-strand breaks daily
🔥 10,000 oxidative modifications

If repair didn't keep up, you'd develop cancer in days.

The repair pathways:

🔧 BER (Base Excision Repair) — fixes oxidized/damaged bases
✂️ NER (Nucleotide Excision Repair) — removes bulky adducts, UV damage
🔗 HR/NHEJ — fixes double-strand breaks
🎯 MMR (Mismatch Repair) — corrects replication errors

Here's the problem:

Aging isn't just accumulated damage—it's declining repair capacity.

Your repair systems slow down. Errors accumulate. Cancer risk rises.

The opportunity: ENHANCE REPAIR CAPACITY

🔋 NAD+ — PARP enzymes (DNA repair) require NAD+ as cofuel
🥦 Sulforaphane — Activates Nrf2, upregulates repair genes
🍽️ Fasting — Activates SIRT1, SIRT6 (both involved in DNA repair)
🏃 Exercise — Enhances oxidative damage repair
😴 Sleep — Major DNA repair occurs during deep sleep
🧬 Spermidine — Supports chromatin stability

The genetic piece:

Variants in repair genes (BRCA1/2, ATM, CHEK2) dramatically affect your baseline capacity. If you have compromised repair genes, you need to work harder on the enhancers above.

You can't prevent DNA damage. But you can maximize repair.
