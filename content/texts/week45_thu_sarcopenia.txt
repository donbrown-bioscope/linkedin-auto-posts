📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: MUSCLE MASS & SARCOPENIA

Muscle is the organ of longevity. Sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) begins at 30 and accelerates to 3-8% loss per decade. Prevent it or reverse it.

What Is Sarcopenia?

Progressive loss of muscle mass, strength, and function with age.

Linked to:
→ Increased falls
→ Fractures
→ Metabolic dysfunction
→ Mortality

Diagnosed by: Low muscle mass (DEXA) + low strength (grip) or performance (gait speed).

It's preventable AND reversible!

Shocking Stats:

📉 30% muscle loss by age 80 if sedentary
📉 3-8% decline per decade after 30
📉 2x mortality risk with sarcopenia

Prevention & Treatment:

🏋️ Resistance training 2-3x/week (MOST IMPORTANT!)
🥩 Protein 1.2-1.6g/kg/day
🥚 Leucine-rich foods
☀️ Vitamin D
💊 Creatine
🧬 Optimize hormones (testosterone, GH)

Track with DEXA, grip strength, gait speed.

Never too late to start!
