🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: BRCA1/2

The most famous cancer genes. Carriers have up to 85% lifetime breast cancer risk—but knowledge enables life-saving prevention.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes involved in DNA repair. When they're mutated, cells can't properly fix double-strand DNA breaks, leading to cancer.

Lifetime Cancer Risk: BRCA vs. General Population

🎀 Breast Cancer (Female)
General: 12% | BRCA1/2: 45-85%

🎗️ Ovarian Cancer
General: 1.3% | BRCA1/2: 10-46%

🔵 Prostate Cancer (Male BRCA2)
General: 12% | BRCA2: 20-30%

🟣 Pancreatic Cancer
General: 1.5% | BRCA2: 5-10%

Who Should Test:

→ Personal history of breast cancer <50
→ Triple-negative breast cancer
→ Ovarian cancer at any age
→ Male breast cancer
→ Multiple family members with breast/ovarian cancer
→ Ashkenazi Jewish heritage (1 in 40 carry BRCA)

Prevention Options for Carriers:

✅ Enhanced screening (MRI + mammogram starting at 25-30)
✅ Risk-reducing mastectomy (reduces risk by 90%+)
✅ Risk-reducing oophorectomy (after childbearing)
✅ Chemoprevention (tamoxifen, raloxifene)
✅ PARP inhibitors for treatment (targeted therapy)

The critical insight: Knowing your BRCA status gives you OPTIONS. Angelina Jolie's preventive mastectomy was controversial—but she went from 87% lifetime risk to <5%.

Knowledge is power. Ignorance is not protection.
