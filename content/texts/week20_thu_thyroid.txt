📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: THYROID OPTIMIZATION BEYOND TSH

TSH alone misses most thyroid problems. A "normal" TSH can coexist with profound hypothyroid symptoms. You need the full picture.

The thyroid controls metabolism, energy, mood, weight, and virtually every system. Standard care checks only TSH—missing the complexity.

Complete Thyroid Panel:

🔬 TSH
Standard "normal": 0.4-4.5 mIU/L
Optimal: 1.0-2.0 mIU/L

🔬 Free T4
Storage hormone. Optimal: Upper half of range

🔬 Free T3
Active hormone. Optimal: Upper third of range

🔬 Reverse T3
Inactive form. Optimal: <15 ng/dL
High rT3 = conversion problem

🔬 TPO Antibodies
Hashimoto's marker. Optimal: <35 IU/mL

🔬 TG Antibodies
Another autoimmune marker. Optimal: <20 IU/mL

Standard Care vs. Optimal Function:

⚠️ Standard Approach:
→ Only checks TSH
→ Treats at TSH >4.5
→ Ignores symptoms if "normal"
→ Doesn't check T3 conversion
→ Misses autoimmune thyroiditis

✅ Optimal Approach:
→ Full panel including Free T3, rT3
→ Targets TSH 1.0-2.0
→ Treats subclinical dysfunction
→ Monitors conversion (T4→T3)
→ Addresses autoimmune markers

Common Missed Diagnoses:

→ Poor T4→T3 conversion
→ High reverse T3 (stress, illness)
→ Early Hashimoto's (antibodies positive, TSH normal)
→ Subclinical hypothyroidism

Test comprehensively. Optimize, don't just normalize.
