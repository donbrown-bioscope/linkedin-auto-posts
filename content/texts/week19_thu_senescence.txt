📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: THE SENESCENCE BURDEN

Senescent cells are "zombie cells"—alive but dysfunctional. They don't die, they don't divide, and they poison their neighbors with inflammatory signals.

Cellular senescence is a state where cells permanently stop dividing but resist death. They accumulate with age and drive aging itself.

The SASP: Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype

Senescent cells constantly secrete inflammatory factors:

☠️ IL-6, IL-8 — Inflammation
☠️ MMP-3 — Tissue destruction
☠️ VEGF — Abnormal blood vessel growth
☠️ TGF-β — Fibrosis
☠️ TNF-α — Cell death signals
☠️ CCL2 — Immune cell attraction
☠️ PAI-1 — Clotting dysfunction
☠️ ROS — Oxidative damage

This toxic secretome damages surrounding healthy tissue and spreads senescence to neighboring cells.

What Drives Senescence:

→ Telomere shortening
→ DNA damage
→ Oncogene activation
→ Oxidative stress
→ Inflammation
→ Mitochondrial dysfunction

Senolytic Strategies (Killing Zombie Cells):

✅ Dasatinib + Quercetin (Mayo Clinic protocol)
✅ Fisetin (natural flavonoid)
✅ Exercise (clears senescent cells)
✅ Fasting (autophagy clears them)
✅ Hyperbaric oxygen (shown in trials)
✅ Navitoclax (research compound)

Removing even a small percentage of senescent cells in mice dramatically extends healthspan. Human trials are underway.
