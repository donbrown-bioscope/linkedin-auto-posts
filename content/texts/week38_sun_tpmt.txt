🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: TPMT

A life-saving pharmacogenomic test. TPMT variants can cause fatal bone marrow suppression from standard doses of thiopurine drugs.

TPMT Activity Levels:

Normal (89% of population):
✅ Full enzyme activity
✅ Standard dosing OK
✅ Normal drug metabolism

Intermediate (10%):
⚠️ 50% dose reduction needed
⚠️ Increased toxicity risk
⚠️ Requires closer monitoring

Poor Metabolizer (0.3%):
🚫 90% dose reduction or avoid
🚫 Severe myelosuppression risk
🚫 Consider alternative therapy

Affected Drugs:

💊 Azathioprine (Imuran)
💊 Mercaptopurine (6-MP)
💊 Thioguanine

Clinical Uses:
→ Inflammatory bowel disease
→ Leukemia
→ Organ transplant
→ Autoimmune diseases

FDA recommends TPMT testing before prescribing thiopurines. Testing can prevent life-threatening bone marrow toxicity.
