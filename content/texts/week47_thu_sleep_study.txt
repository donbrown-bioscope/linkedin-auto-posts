📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: SLEEP STUDY & SLEEP ARCHITECTURE

Sleep is the foundation of health. A sleep study reveals apnea, sleep stages, and architecture—the blueprint for restorative sleep.

Sleep Stages (Optimal Architecture):

😴 Light (N1/N2): 50-60%
Transition, memory consolidation

😴 Deep (N3): 15-25%
Physical repair, HGH release

😴 REM: 20-25%
Cognitive, emotional processing

😴 Awakenings: <5%
Brief arousals are normal

Key Sleep Study Metrics:

📊 AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index):
• <5 normal
• 5-15 mild
• 15-30 moderate
• >30 severe

📊 O2 Saturation: >90%
📊 Sleep Efficiency: >85%
📊 Sleep Latency: <20 min
📊 REM Latency: 70-120 min

Testing Options:

→ In-lab polysomnography (gold standard)
→ Home sleep test (apnea screening)

Optimize: Sleep hygiene, CPAP if needed, address underlying causes.
