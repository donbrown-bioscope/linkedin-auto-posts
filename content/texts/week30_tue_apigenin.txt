💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: APIGENIN

The chamomile flavonoid with longevity potential. Apigenin inhibits CD38, preserving NAD+ levels—and promotes deep, restorative sleep.

Why CD38 Inhibition Matters:

CD38 is a major NAD+-consuming enzyme that increases with age:
→ By age 50, CD38 activity doubles
→ This depletes NAD+ levels
→ NAD+ is essential for cellular energy and repair

Apigenin inhibits CD38, helping preserve NAD+ levels without needing precursors like NMN or NR.

Natural Sources:

🌿 Chamomile tea (richest source)
🌿 Parsley
🌿 Celery
🌿 Artichokes

Key Benefits:

😴 Sleep quality improvement (GABA modulation)
🔋 NAD+ preservation (CD38 inhibition)
😌 Anxiolytic effects (calming)
🔥 Anti-inflammatory

Dosing:

→ 50-100mg daily for general use
→ Often taken in evening for sleep benefits
→ Can combine with NMN/NR for synergistic NAD+ support

The combination of sleep benefits plus NAD+ preservation makes apigenin a powerful addition to any longevity protocol.
