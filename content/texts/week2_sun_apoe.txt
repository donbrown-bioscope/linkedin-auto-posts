🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: APOE

The most important gene you've probably never been tested for.

APOE (Apolipoprotein E) affects your risk for Alzheimer's disease more than any other common genetic variant—and it influences cardiovascular disease, longevity, and how you should eat.

The Variants:

🛡️ APOE ε2/ε2 (1-2%)
→ Lowest Alzheimer's risk
→ May have lipid abnormalities
→ Associated with longevity

⚖️ APOE ε3/ε3 (60%)
→ "Neutral" baseline risk
→ Most common genotype

⚠️ APOE ε3/ε4 (20-25%)
→ 2-3x increased Alzheimer's risk
→ Higher LDL response to saturated fat

🚨 APOE ε4/ε4 (2-3%)
→ 8-12x increased Alzheimer's risk
→ Earliest average age of onset
→ BUT: Not destiny—lifestyle matters enormously

Why This Changes Everything:

For ε4 carriers:
→ Saturated fat raises LDL more than non-carriers
→ Alcohol has greater cognitive risk
→ Exercise is MORE protective (not less)
→ Earlier and more aggressive prevention makes sense

The Controversy:

Some say "don't test—there's nothing you can do."

We disagree. ε4 carriers who know their status can:
✓ Optimize diet (Mediterranean, lower saturated fat)
✓ Prioritize exercise (proven to reduce risk)
✓ Avoid excessive alcohol
✓ Monitor cognition earlier
✓ Consider preventive trials

Knowledge enables action. Ignorance doesn't protect you.
