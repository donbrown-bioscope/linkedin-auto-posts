📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: MULTI-CANCER EARLY DETECTION

We have standard screening for 5 cancers:
→ Breast (mammogram)
→ Colon (colonoscopy)
→ Cervical (Pap smear)
→ Lung (CT for high-risk)
→ Prostate (PSA, controversial)

That leaves ~70% of cancer deaths from cancers we've never had a way to screen for.

Pancreatic. Ovarian. Liver. Stomach. Esophageal.

By the time these cause symptoms, they're often stage IV.

Enter MCED: Multi-Cancer Early Detection

A single blood draw that can detect signals from 50+ cancer types.

How it works:

🩸 Blood draw → 🧬 cfDNA extraction → 🔍 Methylation analysis → 📍 Cancer Signal Origin

Tumors shed cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the bloodstream. This DNA carries cancer-specific methylation patterns that can identify:

1. IF a cancer signal is present
2. WHERE in the body to look

The numbers:

✓ 50+ cancer types detected
✓ 83% detection rate for Stage I-III cancers
✓ 0.5% false positive rate
✓ 88% accuracy for tissue of origin

The key value:

For pancreatic cancer, median survival at diagnosis is ~6 months.

MCED can detect it when it's still localized—when survival is 5+ years.

This isn't replacing your colonoscopy or mammogram. It's adding coverage for the cancers we've never been able to find early.
