🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: CYP2C19

Plavix saves lives after heart attacks—unless you're a poor metabolizer. Then it's no better than placebo.

CYP2C19 is a liver enzyme that activates clopidogrel (Plavix) and metabolizes PPIs, some antidepressants, and antifungals. 30% of people have variants that significantly affect drug response.

The Metabolizer Types:

⚡ Ultra-Rapid Metabolizer (5-30%)
Drugs cleared too fast. PPIs less effective. May need higher doses.

✓ Normal Metabolizer (35-50%)
Standard drug response. Plavix works as expected.

⚠️ Intermediate Metabolizer (18-45%)
Reduced Plavix activation. Consider alternatives or dose adjustment.

🚨 Poor Metabolizer (2-15%)
Plavix essentially inactive—cannot convert prodrug to active form. Use prasugrel or ticagrelor instead.

Major Drugs Affected:

💊 Clopidogrel (Plavix) — Antiplatelet
💊 Omeprazole/Esomeprazole — PPIs
💊 Citalopram/Escitalopram — SSRIs
💊 Voriconazole — Antifungal

The Clinical Impact:

After a stent, poor metabolizers on Plavix have 3x higher risk of stent thrombosis—a potentially fatal event.

The FDA now recommends CYP2C19 testing before prescribing Plavix. Yet most cardiologists still don't test.

A $200 pharmacogenomic test could be the difference between life and death.
