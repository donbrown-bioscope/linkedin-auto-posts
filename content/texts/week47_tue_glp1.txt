💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: GLP-1 AGONISTS

The metabolic revolution. GLP-1 agonists like semaglutide deliver 15-20% weight loss plus cardiovascular, kidney, and potentially longevity benefits.

How GLP-1 Agonists Work:

Mimic the GLP-1 hormone:
→ Slow gastric emptying
→ Increase satiety
→ Improve insulin sensitivity
→ Reduce appetite

Weight loss primarily from fat (preserving muscle with protein + resistance training).

Also reduce inflammation, improve lipids, lower blood pressure.

Available Drugs:

💉 Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy)
Weekly injection. ~15% weight loss. CV benefit proven.

💉 Tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound)
GLP-1 + GIP dual agonist. ~20% weight loss.

💉 Liraglutide (Saxenda)
Daily injection. ~8% weight loss. First-gen.

Beyond Weight Loss:

📈 20% CV event reduction
📈 Kidney protection
📈 Reduced fatty liver
📈 Improved sleep apnea
📈 Potential anti-aging effects

Side effects: GI (nausea, constipation). Must combine with lifestyle for best results.
