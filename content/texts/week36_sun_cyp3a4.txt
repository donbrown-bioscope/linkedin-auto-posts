🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: CYP3A4

The most important drug-metabolizing enzyme. CYP3A4 processes ~50% of all prescription medications. Variants and interactions can make or break drug therapy.

CYP3A4 is expressed mainly in the liver and intestines. It metabolizes an enormous range of drugs.

Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A4:

💊 Statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin)
💊 Calcium channel blockers
💊 HIV medications
💊 Immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, tacrolimus)
💊 Benzodiazepines (midazolam, alprazolam)
💊 Opioids (fentanyl, oxycodone)
💊 Steroids
💊 Many chemotherapy drugs
💊 Macrolide antibiotics
💊 Antifungals
💊 Hormones (testosterone, estrogen)

Critical Interactions:

⬆️ INHIBITORS (increase drug levels):
→ Grapefruit juice
→ Ketoconazole
→ Ritonavir
→ Erythromycin
→ Diltiazem

⬇️ INDUCERS (decrease drug levels):
→ St. John's Wort
→ Rifampin
→ Phenytoin
→ Carbamazepine

A single glass of grapefruit juice can dramatically increase drug levels for many CYP3A4 substrates.

Understanding CYP3A4 status and interactions is essential for safe prescribing.
