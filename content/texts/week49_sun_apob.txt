🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: APOB

The true measure of atherogenic risk. ApoB counts every particle that can cause atherosclerosis—better than LDL-C alone.

What ApoB Is:

ApoB is the protein on LDL, VLDL, IDL, and Lp(a) particles.

One ApoB = one atherogenic particle.

Unlike LDL-C (which measures cholesterol content), ApoB counts particles directly.

More particles = more risk, regardless of cholesterol content.

Target Levels:

✅ Optimal: < 80 mg/dL
⚠️ Borderline: 80-100 mg/dL
🔴 High Risk: > 100 mg/dL

Why ApoB Matters:

ApoB is superior to LDL-C when they disconcord.

If LDL-C is "normal" but ApoB is high, you have more small dense LDL particles—higher risk than expected.

Test ApoB, not just standard lipids!
