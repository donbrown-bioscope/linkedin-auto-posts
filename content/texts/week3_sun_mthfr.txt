🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: MTHFR

The methylation gene that affects everything from mood to heart disease.

MTHFR (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase) converts folate into its active form—methylfolate. This is essential for:

→ DNA synthesis and repair
→ Neurotransmitter production
→ Homocysteine clearance
→ Detoxification pathways

40% of people have variants that slow this enzyme down.

The Variants:

✓ Normal (Wild Type)
→ Full enzyme activity
→ Standard folate processing

⚠️ C677T Heterozygous (40%)
→ ~35% reduced activity
→ Mildly elevated homocysteine risk

🚨 C677T Homozygous (10-15%)
→ ~70% reduced activity
→ Significantly elevated homocysteine
→ Higher folate requirements

⚠️ A1298C
→ Milder effect, but compounds with C677T

Why This Matters:

Elevated homocysteine is linked to:
→ Cardiovascular disease
→ Stroke
→ Cognitive decline
→ Pregnancy complications
→ Depression

The Fix Is Simple:

If you have MTHFR variants:
✓ Use methylfolate (not folic acid)
✓ Consider methylcobalamin (active B12)
✓ Monitor homocysteine levels
✓ Ensure adequate B6

Folic acid (synthetic) requires MTHFR to become active. If your enzyme is slow, folic acid can accumulate while you remain functionally deficient.

Methylfolate bypasses the problem entirely.

This is precision medicine in action—matching your supplements to your genetics.
