💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: UROLITHIN A

The mitophagy activator. Urolithin A triggers your cells to recycle damaged mitochondria, improving muscle function and cellular energy—especially important with age.

What Is Mitophagy?

Mitophagy is the selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria:
→ Dysfunctional mitochondria produce excess ROS
→ They also produce less ATP
→ Urolithin A activates PINK1/Parkin pathways
→ Damaged mitochondria are cleared
→ New, healthy mitochondria can form

The Gut Microbiome Problem:

Urolithin A comes from pomegranate ellagitannins—but only if you have the right gut bacteria.

Studies show:
→ Only 40% of people can produce it naturally
→ Gut microbiome composition determines production
→ Direct supplementation bypasses this limitation

Key Benefits:

💪 Muscle strength improvement
🔋 Mitochondrial health
🏃 Endurance capacity
🧓 Healthy aging

Clinical Evidence:

Human trials show:
→ Improved muscle function in elderly
→ Biomarkers of mitochondrial health improved
→ 500-1000mg daily doses studied
→ Timeline brand (Mitopure) has clinical data

One of the most promising mitochondrial health interventions.
