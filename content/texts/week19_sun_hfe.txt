🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: HFE

The most common genetic disease in Caucasians. 1 in 200 have it. Your body absorbs too much iron, and iron is toxic when it accumulates.

HFE regulates iron absorption from the gut. When mutated, the body can't sense iron overload and keeps absorbing more.

Prevalence (C282Y mutation):

C/C (Normal): Standard iron regulation
C/Y (Carrier): 1 in 10 Caucasians carry one copy
Y/Y (Affected): 1 in 200 — Clinical hemochromatosis

Men are more affected (women lose iron through menstruation until menopause).

Organs Damaged by Iron Overload:

🔴 Liver — Cirrhosis, liver cancer
❤️ Heart — Cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias
🔵 Pancreas — "Bronze diabetes"
🦴 Joints — Arthritis (especially 2nd/3rd knuckles)
🟤 Skin — Bronze discoloration
🧠 Pituitary — Hypogonadism
⚡ Thyroid — Hypothyroidism
⚙️ Adrenals — Insufficiency

The Tragedy:

Most people discover hemochromatosis AFTER organ damage occurs. Symptoms are vague: fatigue, joint pain, brain fog. Often misdiagnosed for years.

The Solution:

If you're Y/Y:
→ Monitor ferritin and transferrin saturation
→ Therapeutic phlebotomy (blood donation) to reduce iron
→ Avoid iron supplements and vitamin C with meals
→ Limit red meat intake

Early detection = normal lifespan. Late detection = organ failure.
