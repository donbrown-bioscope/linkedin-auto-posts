💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: SPERMIDINE

A natural polyamine that mimics fasting's benefits. It triggers autophagy—your cells' cleanup and recycling system—without caloric restriction.

Spermidine is found in all living cells and declines with age. It's one of the most promising longevity compounds with robust epidemiological data.

How Spermidine Triggers Autophagy:

1️⃣ Spermidine intake (food or supplement)
2️⃣ Alters protein acetylation patterns
3️⃣ Activates autophagy machinery
4️⃣ Damaged proteins and organelles recycled
5️⃣ Cellular renewal and rejuvenation

High-Spermidine Foods:

🥗 Wheat germ (highest known source)
🧀 Aged cheese (especially blue, cheddar)
🍄 Mushrooms
🫘 Soybeans and natto
🌱 Legumes (lentils, green peas)
🥦 Broccoli, cauliflower

The Evidence:

📊 Austrian population study: High dietary spermidine = 5+ year mortality difference (top vs. bottom tertile)

📊 Human trials show improved memory in older adults

📊 Cardiovascular benefits documented

📊 Extends lifespan in multiple model organisms

Dosing:

Food approach: Emphasize high-spermidine foods
Supplement: 1-6 mg daily (research doses vary)
Wheat germ: 1-2 tablespoons provides ~5mg

One of the safest longevity interventions available—it's just food-derived.
