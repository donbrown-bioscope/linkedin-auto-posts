💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: NMN/NR (NAD+ Precursors)

Your NAD+ levels drop 50% by middle age.

NAD+ is the central molecule of cellular energy and repair. When it declines, so does your ability to:
→ Produce ATP (energy)
→ Activate sirtuins (longevity genes)
→ Repair DNA damage
→ Maintain mitochondrial function

NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) and NR (Nicotinamide Riboside) are precursors that can push NAD+ levels back up.

The Evidence:

📊 2021 Science study: NMN improved insulin sensitivity in prediabetic women
❤️ Trials showing improved arterial function and blood pressure
🏃 Exercise capacity enhancement in multiple studies
🧬 Activation of SIRT1 and PARP (DNA repair enzymes)

Dosing:
→ NMN: 250-1000mg/day
→ NR: 300-600mg/day
→ Best taken in the morning (NAD+ follows circadian rhythm)

Key Considerations:

✓ Quality sourcing is critical—degradation is common
✓ Synergizes with exercise and fasting
✓ May take 2-4 weeks to notice effects
✓ Some prefer sublingual NMN for better absorption

The NAD+ decline with aging may be one of the most actionable targets in longevity medicine. Restoring youthful levels supports virtually every cellular function.
