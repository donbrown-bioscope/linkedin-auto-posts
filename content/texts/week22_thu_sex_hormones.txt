📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: SEX HORMONE OPTIMIZATION

Total testosterone tells half the story. Free testosterone, metabolites, and ratios determine how hormones actually work in your body.

Sex hormones decline with age, but "normal for age" isn't the same as "optimal for function."

Complete Male Panel:

🔵 Total Testosterone (optimal: 600-900 ng/dL)
🔵 Free Testosterone (2-3% of total)
🔵 SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin)
🔵 Estradiol (E2) — not too high OR too low
🔵 DHT (dihydrotestosterone)
🔵 LH, FSH (pituitary function)
🔵 Prolactin (if elevated, suppresses T)

Complete Female Panel:

🔴 Estradiol (E2), Estrone (E1), Estriol (E3)
🔴 Progesterone (especially luteal phase)
🔴 Testosterone (total and free)
🔴 DHEA-S (adrenal androgens)
🔴 SHBG, LH, FSH
🔴 2-OH/16-OH estrogen ratio
🔴 Timing: Day 19-21 for cycling women

Why Metabolites Matter:

Estrogen metabolism determines risk:
→ 2-OH estrogens: Protective pathway
→ 4-OH estrogens: More genotoxic
→ 16-OH estrogens: More proliferative

DUTCH testing measures these ratios. Optimize pathways with DIM, calcium-d-glucarate, cruciferous vegetables, and methylation support.

The balance matters more than absolute numbers.
