📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: ADVANCED LIPID TESTING

Your standard cholesterol panel misses half the picture. Advanced testing reveals the particle-level truth about your cardiovascular risk.

The Problem with Standard Testing:

LDL-C measures cholesterol mass inside LDL particles.

But cardiovascular risk comes from the NUMBER of atherogenic particles—not how much cholesterol they carry.

You can have:
→ "Normal" LDL-C with MANY small particles (high risk)
→ "High" LDL-C with FEW large particles (lower risk)

Standard testing misses this distinction.

Beyond LDL-C: What to Measure

🎯 ApoB
One ApoB molecule per atherogenic particle. Direct count of particles that cause atherosclerosis. The single best lipid marker.

⚠️ Lp(a)
Genetically determined, independent risk factor. Elevated in 20% of people. Standard panels don't include it. One test, once in your life.

📊 LDL-P (Particle Number)
Total number of LDL particles via NMR spectroscopy. More predictive than LDL-C for many people.

🔬 Particle Size Distribution
Small dense LDL is more atherogenic—penetrates arterial walls more easily.

Standard vs. Advanced:

Standard Panel: Total-C, LDL-C (calculated), HDL-C, Triglycerides

Advanced Panel: ApoB, Lp(a), LDL-P by NMR, particle size, oxidized LDL

The Action Step:

Ask for ApoB and Lp(a) on your next blood work. If your standard panel looks "fine" but these are elevated, you have residual risk that needs addressing.
