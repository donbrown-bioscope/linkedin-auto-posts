🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: DRD2

The reward pathway gene. DRD2 variants affect dopamine signaling, influencing addiction risk, reward sensitivity, and impulsive behavior.

DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2) is central to the brain's reward system. Variants affect receptor density and function.

Normal DRD2 Density:
✅ Adequate dopamine signaling
✅ Normal reward response
✅ Lower addiction risk
✅ Standard impulse control
✅ Typical motivation

Reduced DRD2 (A1 allele):
⚠️ 30-40% fewer D2 receptors
⚠️ Blunted reward response
⚠️ Higher addiction risk
⚠️ Seek more stimulation
⚠️ "Reward Deficiency Syndrome"

Clinical Implications:

A1 allele carriers need more stimulation to feel "normal"—leading to increased risk of:
→ Alcohol use disorder
→ Drug addiction
→ Food addiction/obesity
→ Gambling
→ Compulsive behaviors

Understanding Your Risk:

Genetic knowledge enables personalized prevention:
→ Higher awareness of addiction vulnerability
→ Avoid recreational substance use
→ Find healthy dopamine sources (exercise, achievement)
→ Consider this in pain management decisions
