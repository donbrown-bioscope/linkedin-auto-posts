📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: CARDIAC CT ANGIOGRAPHY (CCTA)

See beyond calcium. CCTA visualizes your coronary arteries with contrast dye, revealing soft plaque that CAC scores miss—the plaque most likely to rupture.

What CCTA Shows:

CCTA uses IV contrast dye to create detailed 3D images of coronary arteries.

It detects:
→ Stenosis (narrowing)
→ Soft/vulnerable plaque
→ Calcified plaque
→ Anomalous vessels

Non-invasive alternative to cardiac catheterization for many patients.

CAC vs CCTA:

CAC Score (No Contrast):
• Detects calcified plaque only
• Lower radiation
• Good for screening
• Can't assess stenosis

CCTA (With Contrast):
• Detects ALL plaque types
• Shows vulnerable soft plaque
• Quantifies stenosis %
• Better risk prediction

When to Consider CCTA:

✅ CAC score > 0
✅ Symptoms suggesting CAD
✅ Stress test inconclusive
✅ Pre-operative clearance
✅ Comprehensive plaque assessment

Requires IV contrast and heart rate control (beta-blocker).
