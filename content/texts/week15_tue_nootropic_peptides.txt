💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: NOOTROPIC PEPTIDES
🧬 Peptide Series

Russian neuroscience developed these peptides for cosmonauts and soldiers. Now they're used for anxiety, focus, and neuroprotection.

🧘 SELANK

A synthetic analog of the naturally occurring immunomodulatory peptide tuftsin.

How it works:
→ Modulates GABA system (anxiolytic effect)
→ Enhances BDNF expression
→ Immune modulation (from tuftsin backbone)

Benefits:
→ Reduces anxiety without sedation
→ No addiction potential or tolerance
→ Improves stress resilience
→ May enhance learning and memory

Delivery: Nasal spray, typically 200-400mcg per dose

⚡ SEMAX

A synthetic analog of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) fragment.

How it works:
→ Potent BDNF enhancer (up to 800% in some studies)
→ Modulates dopamine and serotonin
→ Neuroprotective mechanisms

Benefits:
→ Cognitive enhancement
→ Improved attention and memory
→ Neuroprotection (used for stroke recovery in Russia)
→ May help with ADHD symptoms

Delivery: Nasal spray, typically 200-600mcg per dose

Clinical History:

Both peptides have been used clinically in Russia for 25+ years. They're approved medications there, not experimental compounds. Safety profiles are excellent with decades of human use.

Neither is FDA-approved in the US, but they're available through research/compounding channels.

For those seeking cognitive enhancement without stimulants or addiction risk, these represent a sophisticated option.
