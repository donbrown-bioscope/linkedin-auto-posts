📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: CAROTID INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS

Measure your artery wall thickness. CIMT uses ultrasound to detect early atherosclerosis before plaques form—and tracks changes over time.

What Is CIMT?

Carotid Intima-Media Thickness measures the combined thickness of the two inner layers (intima and media) of the carotid artery wall.

It's a marker of systemic atherosclerosis—what's happening in the carotid reflects coronary arteries.

CIMT Values:

✅ Normal: < 0.8 mm
Low cardiovascular risk

⚠️ Elevated: 0.8-1.0 mm
Intermediate risk, optimize risk factors

🚨 High / Plaque: > 1.0 mm
High risk, aggressive intervention needed

Advantages of CIMT:

✅ No radiation
✅ Non-invasive
✅ Reproducible
✅ Tracks changes over time
✅ Detects disease before calcium
✅ Age-adjusted percentiles available
✅ Can repeat annually

Clinical Utility:

→ Screen intermediate-risk patients
→ Monitor intervention effectiveness
→ Motivate lifestyle changes
→ Detect subclinical atherosclerosis
