📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: GROWTH HORMONE & IGF-1 BALANCE

The longevity paradox: GH/IGF-1 builds muscle and burns fat, but lower levels are associated with longer lifespan. The goal is optimization, not maximization.

Growth hormone is released by the pituitary in pulses (mostly during sleep). It stimulates IGF-1 production in the liver, which mediates most of GH's effects.

The IGF-1 Trade-off:

📉 Lower IGF-1:
✓ Associated with longevity
✓ Reduced cancer risk
✓ More autophagy
✓ Less cellular proliferation
⚠️ Less muscle, bone, cognition

📈 Higher IGF-1:
✓ Better muscle mass
✓ Stronger bones
✓ Improved cognition
✓ Better body composition
⚠️ Potentially higher cancer risk

Natural GH Optimization:

✅ Deep sleep (biggest driver — 70% of GH released during sleep)
✅ Fasting / Time-restricted eating
✅ High-intensity exercise (sprints, weights)
✅ Protein timing (adequate but not excessive)
✅ Minimize sugar and insulin spikes
✅ Sauna (heat stress)
✅ Amino acids (arginine, ornithine — modest effect)

Optimal IGF-1 Range:

Target mid-range for age (not bottom or top). Very low IGF-1 = frailty risk. Very high = cancer risk. Balance is key.
