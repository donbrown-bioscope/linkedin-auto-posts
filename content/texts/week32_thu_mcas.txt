📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: MAST CELL ACTIVATION SYNDROME (MCAS)

When mast cells overreact to everything. MCAS causes chronic, multi-system symptoms that mimic allergies, autoimmunity, and more—often for years without diagnosis.

What Are Mast Cells?

Mast cells are immune sentinels that release:
→ Histamine
→ Prostaglandins
→ Cytokines
→ 200+ other mediators

In MCAS, they degranulate inappropriately—triggered by stress, foods, heat, cold, exercise, or seemingly nothing.

Note: MCAS is NOT the same as mastocytosis (too many mast cells).

Common Symptoms:

🔴 Flushing
😵 Brain fog
💓 Tachycardia
🤢 GI issues (nausea, diarrhea, pain)
😰 Anxiety
🦴 Joint pain
😴 Fatigue
🤧 Nasal congestion

Testing (Challenging):

🔬 Serum tryptase
🔬 24-hr urine prostaglandin D2
🔬 Urine histamine metabolites
🔬 Plasma histamine (special handling required)

Tests often normal between flares. Clinical diagnosis criteria exist.

Treatment Approach:

→ H1 and H2 antihistamines
→ Mast cell stabilizers (cromolyn, quercetin)
→ Low-histamine diet
→ Trigger avoidance
→ Address underlying conditions
