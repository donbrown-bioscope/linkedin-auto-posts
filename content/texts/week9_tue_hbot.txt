💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY

At 2-3 atmospheres of pressure, oxygen dissolves directly into plasma—15x normal levels. Every cell gets flooded with the fuel of life.

What happens in a hyperbaric chamber:

🔬 The Hyperbaric Difference:
→ 2-3x atmospheric pressure
→ 15x plasma oxygen levels
→ 800% increase in stem cell mobilization

This isn't just "breathing oxygen." The pressure forces oxygen into tissues that red blood cells can't reach—damaged areas, areas with poor circulation, areas that have been hypoxic for years.

Benefits:

🧠 Brain recovery (TBI, stroke, cognitive decline)
🩹 Accelerated wound healing
🦴 Bone repair and regeneration
🔥 Reduced inflammation
🧬 Telomere lengthening
👴 Senescent cell reduction
🏃 Athletic recovery
💉 New blood vessel formation (angiogenesis)

The Evidence:

In a landmark 2020 Israeli study, 60 sessions of HBOT in healthy adults 64+ achieved something remarkable:
→ 20% increase in telomere length
→ 37% reduction in senescent cells

This was the first intervention ever shown to reverse these aging markers in humans.

FDA-approved indications include decompression sickness, non-healing wounds, and radiation injury. Off-label use for longevity and brain health is expanding rapidly.

Protocol typically involves 60-minute sessions, 5 days/week, for 40-60 total sessions.
