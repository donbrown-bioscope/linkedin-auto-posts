📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: AUTOIMMUNE TRIGGERS

Autoimmunity requires three things: genetic susceptibility + environmental trigger + intestinal permeability. Remove any one and disease may not develop.

The Autoimmune Triad (Fasano Model):

1️⃣ Genetic susceptibility (HLA genes)
2️⃣ Environmental trigger
3️⃣ Leaky gut (intestinal permeability)

= Autoimmune disease

Key Triggers:

🦠 Infections
EBV, CMV, Lyme, Yersinia—molecular mimicry triggers cross-reactivity with self-tissues

🌾 Gluten
Triggers zonulin release, increases intestinal permeability. Relevant beyond celiac disease.

☠️ Toxins
Heavy metals, mold, pesticides, BPA disrupt immune regulation

😰 Chronic Stress
Cortisol dysregulation, HPA axis dysfunction, immune imbalance

🦠 Gut Dysbiosis
Loss of oral tolerance, LPS translocation, Th17 activation

💊 Medications
NSAIDs, PPIs, antibiotics damage gut barrier and microbiome

Clinical Approach:

→ Identify and remove triggers
→ Heal gut permeability
→ Support detoxification
→ Balance immune function
→ Address underlying infections
