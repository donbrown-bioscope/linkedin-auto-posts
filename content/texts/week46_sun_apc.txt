🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: APC

The colon cancer gatekeeper. APC mutations cause hundreds of polyps and near-certain colon cancer without intervention.

What APC Does:

APC is a tumor suppressor that controls cell growth in the colon.

It regulates:
→ β-catenin
→ Wnt signaling pathway

Loss of APC function leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation.

Mutated in 80% of sporadic colorectal cancers.

APC-Related Conditions:

⚠️ FAP (Familial Adenomatous Polyposis):
• 100s-1000s of polyps by teens/20s
• 100% colon cancer risk by age 40 without surgery
• Also: desmoid tumors, osteomas, thyroid cancer

⚠️ Attenuated FAP:
• Fewer polyps, later onset
• Still high cancer risk

Screening Protocol:

🔬 FAP carriers:
→ Annual colonoscopy starting age 10-12
→ Prophylactic colectomy usually in 20s
→ Screen family members
→ Genetic counseling essential
