💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: HIGH-DOSE OMEGA-3

Most people are deficient. The average American has an Omega-3 Index of 4-5%. Optimal is 8-12%. This gap matters for heart, brain, and longevity.

The Omega-3 Index measures EPA+DHA as a percentage of red blood cell membranes. It's the best marker of omega-3 status.

Omega-3 Index Levels:

🔴 <4%: Deficient (high cardiac risk)
🟠 4-6%: Low (US average)
🟡 6-8%: Adequate
🟢 8-12%: Optimal (Japan average)

Moving from 4% to 8% requires consistent high-dose supplementation.

Benefits of Optimization:

❤️ Triglyceride reduction (30-40% at high doses)
🧠 Brain structure and function
🔥 Anti-inflammatory (resolvin production)
👁️ Retinal health
😊 Mood support
🦴 Joint health
🩸 Blood pressure reduction
⚡ Cell membrane fluidity

Dosing Guidelines:

→ Maintenance: 1-2g EPA+DHA daily
→ Triglyceride reduction: 3-4g EPA+DHA daily
→ Depression: 1-2g EPA dominant formula
→ Inflammation: 2-3g with high EPA

Quality Matters:

→ Third-party tested (IFOS certification)
→ Triglyceride form (better absorbed than ethyl ester)
→ Refrigerate to prevent oxidation
→ Test your Omega-3 Index to confirm you're absorbing
