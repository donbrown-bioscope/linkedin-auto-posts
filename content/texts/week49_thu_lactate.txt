📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: LACTATE THRESHOLD TESTING

Train smarter, not harder. Lactate threshold defines your personal training zones—the key to optimizing endurance and performance.

What Is Lactate Threshold?

The exercise intensity where lactate production exceeds clearance, causing accumulation.

LT1 = aerobic threshold (sustainable for hours)
LT2 = anaerobic threshold (sustainable ~1 hour)

Training at/around these thresholds maximizes adaptations for endurance athletes and longevity seekers alike.

Training Zones:

🟢 Zone 2 (Below LT1): < 2 mmol/L
Fat burning, mitochondrial building. Sustainable for hours.

🟡 LT1 (Aerobic): ~2 mmol/L
Upper limit of easy aerobic work.

🔴 LT2 (Anaerobic): ~4 mmol/L
Race pace. Sustainable ~1 hour max.

Testing:

🔬 Lab (gold standard) or portable meters
🔬 Finger pricks during graded exercise
🔬 Results: Personalized HR and power zones
🔬 Retest every 8-12 weeks
