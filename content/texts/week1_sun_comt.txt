🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: COMT

Why do some people thrive under pressure while others crumble—then outperform everyone when things calm down?

Meet COMT (Catechol-O-Methyltransferase)—the gene that controls how fast your brain clears dopamine.

The fast version clears dopamine 4x faster than the slow version. This single difference shapes your stress response, focus patterns, and even career fit.

The Variants:

⚔️ Val/Val — "The Warrior" (25%)
→ Fast dopamine clearance
→ Calm under pressure, handles stress well
→ May need stimulation (caffeine, deadlines) to focus
→ Advantage: Crisis performance

🧠 Met/Met — "The Worrier" (25%)
→ Slow dopamine clearance
→ Superior memory and attention in calm settings
→ Stress-sensitive, can feel overwhelmed
→ Advantage: Cognitive tasks, deep work

⚖️ Val/Met — "The Balanced" (50%)
→ Intermediate dopamine clearance
→ Adaptable to various conditions
→ Best of both worlds (and limitations)

The Clinical Implications:

💊 Medication selection — COMT status affects response to certain drugs
☕ Caffeine tolerance — Warriors handle it better; Worriers may get anxious
💼 Career guidance — High-pressure vs. contemplative roles
🧘 Stress management — Personalized strategies based on genotype

Neither variant is "better"—they're different tools for different environments.

The Warrior thrives in the ER. The Worrier excels in research. Know which you are.
