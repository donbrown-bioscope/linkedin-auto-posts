🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: VDR

Vitamin D isn't really a vitamin—it's a hormone that regulates over 1,000 genes. VDR variants determine how well you respond to it.

The Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) is a nuclear receptor that, when activated by vitamin D, controls gene expression throughout the body.

What Vitamin D / VDR Controls:

🦴 Bone health and calcium absorption
🛡️ Immune function (innate and adaptive)
🧠 Brain health and mood
💪 Muscle function and strength
❤️ Cardiovascular health
🎗️ Cancer prevention
🔬 Autoimmune modulation
😊 Mood regulation (depression link)

Key VDR Variants:

VDR has several important SNPs:
→ Bsm1 (rs1544410)
→ Taq1 (rs731236)
→ Fok1 (rs2228570) — Most functional
→ Apa1 (rs7975232)

Certain combinations create "poor responders" who:
→ Need higher vitamin D doses
→ Achieve lower blood levels despite supplementation
→ Have increased disease risk despite "normal" levels

Optimal vs. Standard:

Lab "normal" 25(OH)D: 30-100 ng/mL
Functional optimal: 50-70 ng/mL

If you're supplementing 2,000 IU daily and your level won't rise, VDR variants may explain why. Some need 5,000-10,000 IU daily.

Test your genetics. Test your levels. Optimize accordingly.
