🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: LPA (Lipoprotein(a))

The "stealth" cardiovascular risk factor. 20% of people have elevated Lp(a)—and most don't know it. It's genetic, it doesn't respond to lifestyle, and it's rarely tested.

Lp(a) is an LDL-like particle with an extra protein called apolipoprotein(a) attached. Your level is 90% genetically determined by the LPA gene.

Lp(a) Levels & Risk (nmol/L):

🟢 <75: Desirable
🟡 75-125: Borderline risk
🟠 125-250: High risk
🔴 >250: Very high risk

Why Lp(a) Matters:

→ Independent risk factor for heart attack, stroke, aortic stenosis
→ 90% genetically determined — diet and exercise don't lower it
→ Structurally similar to LDL but MORE atherogenic
→ Promotes clotting (mimics plasminogen)
→ Most physicians never test it

The Unique Challenge:

→ Statins don't lower Lp(a) (may even raise it slightly)
→ Diet doesn't affect it
→ Exercise doesn't affect it
→ Niacin lowers it 20-30% (one of few options)
→ PCSK9 inhibitors lower it ~25%
→ New antisense drugs (under development) reduce Lp(a) by 80%+

One test in your lifetime tells you your genetic level. If elevated, you need aggressive management of all OTHER modifiable risk factors.
