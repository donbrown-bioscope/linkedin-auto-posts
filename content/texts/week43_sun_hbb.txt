🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: HBB

The hemoglobin gene. HBB mutations cause sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia—among the most common genetic disorders worldwide.

Key Conditions:

🩸 Sickle Cell Disease
HbS mutation (E6V). Red cells become rigid, sickle-shaped. Causes vaso-occlusive crises, anemia, organ damage. Most common in African descent.

🩸 Sickle Cell Trait
One HbS allele (carrier). Usually asymptomatic. Provides malaria protection.

🩸 Beta-Thalassemia Major
Two severe mutations. Little/no beta-globin. Requires lifelong transfusions. Mediterranean, Middle East, Asian populations.

🩸 Beta-Thalassemia Minor
One mutation (carrier/trait). Mild microcytic anemia. Often mistaken for iron deficiency.

Carrier Screening Critical:

If both parents carry HBB mutations:
→ 25% chance of affected child

Treatment Advances:

🧬 Gene therapy (Casgevy) now FDA-approved for sickle cell
💊 Hydroxyurea
🩸 Transfusions
🦴 Bone marrow transplant
