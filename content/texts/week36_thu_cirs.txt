📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: MOLD ILLNESS (CIRS)

Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome from biotoxins. 24% of people have HLA genes that can't clear mold toxins—leading to multi-system chronic illness.

What Is CIRS?

CIRS (Shoemaker Protocol) occurs when genetically susceptible individuals can't clear biotoxins from mold, Lyme, or other sources.

→ HLA-DR genes determine susceptibility
→ ~24% of population is susceptible
→ Some people live in moldy homes without symptoms
→ Others become severely ill from same exposure

Common Symptoms:

🧠 Brain fog, memory issues
😴 Profound fatigue
🦴 Joint and muscle pain
💨 Shortness of breath
🤧 Chronic sinus issues
⚡ Nerve pain, numbness
👁️ Light sensitivity
😰 Anxiety, mood changes
🌡️ Temperature dysregulation

Testing:

🔬 HLA-DR genotype (susceptibility)
🔬 C4a, TGF-beta1, MSH, VIP (CIRS markers)
🔬 MMP-9, VEGF
🔬 Visual Contrast Sensitivity (VCS) screening
🔬 Mycotoxin urine testing (RealTime Labs, Great Plains)
🔬 ERMI for home mold assessment

Treatment requires getting out of exposure AND following detox protocols.
