📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: CONTINUOUS KETONE MONITORING

Beyond glucose. Ketone monitoring reveals your metabolic flexibility—the ability to switch between fuel sources that defines metabolic health.

What Are Ketones?

Ketones (β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, acetone) are produced when your body burns fat for fuel.

The brain runs 70% on ketones during fasting.

Ketone monitoring shows if you're actually in ketosis and how deeply—validating fasting, keto diet, or exogenous ketone use.

Ketone Levels:

🔴 Not in Ketosis: < 0.5 mM
Glucose-burning. Standard carb metabolism.

🟢 Nutritional Ketosis: 0.5-3.0 mM
Fat-burning. Optimal for most benefits.

🟣 Deep Ketosis: 3.0-6.0 mM
Extended fasting. Therapeutic uses.

Monitoring Devices:

📱 Blood meters (Keto-Mojo, Precision Xtra) - most accurate
📱 Breath analyzers (Biosense)
📱 CGM + ketone combos emerging

Achieve ketosis with:
→ Fasting
→ Keto diet
→ Exogenous ketones (C8 MCT, ketone esters)
