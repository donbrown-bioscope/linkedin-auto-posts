💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: CREATINE

The most studied sports supplement in history. But it's not just for athletes—creatine has profound effects on brain energy and aging.

Creatine is a naturally occurring compound that serves as a rapid energy buffer. It's stored as phosphocreatine and regenerates ATP during high-intensity efforts.

💪 Muscle strength and power
🧠 Cognitive function (especially under stress)
⚡ ATP regeneration speed
🦴 Bone health support
😴 Buffer against sleep deprivation
🏃 Exercise recovery
🧓 Sarcopenia prevention
🛡️ Neuroprotective effects

The Evidence Base:

📊 500+ peer-reviewed studies
📊 Improves high-intensity exercise capacity 10-15%
📊 Increases lean mass by 2-4 lbs (4-12 weeks)
📊 Cognitive benefits especially in vegetarians
📊 Decades of safety data

Dosing:

→ 5g creatine monohydrate daily
→ No loading phase needed
