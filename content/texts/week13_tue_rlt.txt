💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: RED LIGHT THERAPY

Light at specific wavelengths penetrates tissue and directly energizes mitochondria. It's not heat. It's not placebo. It's photochemistry.

Red light therapy (photobiomodulation) uses wavelengths between 630-850nm to stimulate cellular function.

The Therapeutic Wavelengths:

🔴 Red Light (630-660nm)
Penetrates 2-3mm into skin. Excellent for skin health, wound healing, collagen production.

🟣 Near-Infrared (810-850nm)
Penetrates 3-5cm into tissue. Reaches muscles, joints, and even brain through skull.

How It Works:

Light is absorbed by cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV) in mitochondria. This:
→ Enhances electron transport chain efficiency
→ Increases ATP production
→ Reduces oxidative stress
→ Triggers beneficial signaling cascades

Benefits Supported by Research:

🔋 Enhanced ATP production
✨ Skin rejuvenation and collagen synthesis
💪 Faster muscle recovery
🦴 Reduced joint pain and inflammation
🧠 Improved cognitive function (transcranial PBM)
🩹 Accelerated wound healing
😴 Better sleep (red light doesn't suppress melatonin)

Protocol Considerations:

→ Dose matters: 3-50 J/cm² depending on target
→ Distance matters: Follow device recommendations
→ Consistency: Most benefits require regular use
→ Quality: Irradiance (mW/cm²) determines treatment time

This isn't some fringe therapy—NASA developed it for wound healing in space.
