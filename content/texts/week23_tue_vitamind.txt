💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: VITAMIN D OPTIMIZATION

Not actually a vitamin—it's a steroid hormone. 42% of Americans are deficient. Optimal levels require far more than the RDA of 600 IU.

Vitamin D regulates over 1,000 genes affecting immunity, bone health, mood, cardiovascular function, and cancer risk.

25(OH)D Levels (ng/mL):

🔴 <20: Deficient
🟠 20-30: Insufficient
🟡 30-50: Adequate
🟢 50-70: Optimal
⚠️ >100: Potential toxicity

Most functional medicine practitioners target 50-70 ng/mL.

Essential Cofactors (Don't Supplement D Alone):

→ Vitamin K2 (MK-7): Directs calcium to bones, not arteries
→ Magnesium: Required for vitamin D activation
→ Zinc: Vitamin D receptor function
→ Boron: Supports vitamin D metabolism
→ Vitamin A (retinol): Works synergistically with D
→ Fat: Required for absorption (fat-soluble vitamin)

Dosing Guidelines:

→ 1,000 IU raises level ~10 ng/mL (average)
→ Most adults need 4,000-10,000 IU to reach optimal
→ VDR gene variants affect response
→ Obesity requires higher doses
→ Test and adjust (retest in 3 months)

The goal is personalized dosing based on your blood levels, not one-size-fits-all recommendations.
