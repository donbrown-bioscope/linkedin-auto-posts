📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: LYME & TICK-BORNE DISEASES

The great imitator. Lyme disease can mimic MS, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, and more. Standard tests miss up to 50% of cases. Co-infections complicate everything.

Common Tick-Borne Infections:

🦠 Borrelia (Lyme)
Spirochete bacteria causing fatigue, joint pain, neurological symptoms

🦠 Babesia
Malaria-like parasite causing air hunger, night sweats, fatigue

🦠 Bartonella
Neuro symptoms, stretch marks, anxiety, rage

🦠 Ehrlichia/Anaplasma
Fever, low platelets, elevated liver enzymes

🦠 Rickettsia
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever—rash, fever, can be severe

Chronic Lyme Symptoms:

→ Fatigue and brain fog
→ Migratory joint pain
→ Neuropathy and headaches
→ Sleep disturbances
→ Heart palpitations
→ Mood changes

Testing Challenges:

Standard ELISA/Western Blot misses many cases.

Better Options:
🔬 IGeneX
🔬 Vibrant Wellness
🔬 DNA Connexions (PCR)
🔬 ArminLabs (Europe)

Multiple tick-borne infections often coexist—comprehensive testing is essential.
