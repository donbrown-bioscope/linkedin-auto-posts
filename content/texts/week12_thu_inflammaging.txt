📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: INFLAMMAGING

Chronic, low-grade inflammation that increases with age. It's not infection—it's your own immune system slowly damaging every organ.

Inflammaging is the smoldering fire behind virtually every age-related disease:
→ Heart disease
→ Diabetes
→ Alzheimer's
→ Cancer
→ Sarcopenia
→ Frailty

It's not acute inflammation (which is protective). It's persistent, subtle, systemic inflammation that never fully resolves.

Sources of Inflammaging:

🧟 Senescent Cells
"Zombie cells" that secrete inflammatory cytokines (SASP): IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1

🦠 Leaky Gut
Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) crossing into bloodstream triggers immune response

🔋 Mitochondrial Dysfunction
Damaged mitochondria release mtDNA, triggering inflammation

🍔 Metabolic Dysfunction
Visceral fat is an inflammatory organ, constantly producing cytokines

Key Inflammaging Markers:

→ hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein)
→ IL-6 (Interleukin-6)
→ TNF-α (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha)
→ Fibrinogen

These should be measured and tracked, not ignored.

Anti-Inflammaging Strategies:

✅ Fasting / Time-Restricted Eating — Reduces inflammatory markers
✅ Exercise — Acute inflammation that resolves, net anti-inflammatory
✅ Omega-3s — Precursors to resolution molecules
✅ Senolytics — Clear the source (senescent cells)
✅ Gut Health — Fix the leaky gut
✅ Sleep Optimization — Poor sleep is inflammatory
✅ Stress Management — Cortisol dysregulation drives inflammation

Inflammaging is modifiable. Measure it, address the sources, track your progress.
