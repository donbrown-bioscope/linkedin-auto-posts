🍄 Trichothecenes
Water-damaged buildings, Stachybotrys (black mold). Potent immunotoxin.

🍄 Gliotoxin
Aspergillus, Candida. Immunosuppressive. Common in CIRS patients.

🍄 Zearalenone
Corn, wheat, barley. Xenoestrogen. Hormone disruption.

🍄 Citrinin
Grains, fermented foods. Nephrotoxic. Often with Ochratoxin A.

Common Symptoms:

Brain fog, fatigue, headaches, sinus issues, joint pain, skin rashes, GI problems, light sensitivity, anxiety, memory issues.

Testing Options:

🔬 Urinary mycotoxin panel (RealTime Labs, Great Plains)
🔬 Home ERMI testing (mold DNA in dust)
🔬 Visual Contrast Sensitivity (VCS) screening
🔬 HLA-DR genetic susceptibility testing

24% of population has HLA types making them unable to clear mycotoxins effectively.
