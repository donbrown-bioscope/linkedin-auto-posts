💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: L-ERGOTHIONEINE

The proposed "longevity vitamin." Your body has a dedicated transporter (OCTN1) just for ergothioneine—suggesting it's evolutionarily important. Levels decline with age.

What Makes Ergothioneine Special:

→ Unlike most antioxidants, accumulates in tissues with high oxidative stress
→ Concentrates in brain, liver, kidneys, eyes, bone marrow
→ Body has specific transporter (OCTN1/SLC22A4) to capture and retain it
→ Levels correlate with longevity across species
→ Low levels linked to frailty, cognitive decline, mortality

Key Benefits:

🧠 Neuroprotection (crosses blood-brain barrier)
🛡️ Cytoprotection (protects cells from damage)
🔥 Anti-inflammatory
🔋 Mitochondrial support
❤️ Cardiovascular protection
👁️ Eye health
🧬 DNA protection
🧓 Healthy aging marker

Sources:

🍄 Mushrooms (richest source)
→ King oyster, shiitake, porcini highest
🥩 Organ meats
🫘 Some beans

Most people get only 1-3mg/day from diet.
Supplements provide 5-25mg daily.

One of the most promising emerging longevity compounds.
