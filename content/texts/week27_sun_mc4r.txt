🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: MC4R

The most common cause of monogenic obesity. MC4R variants affect hunger signaling and satiety—some people literally never feel full.

The Satiety Pathway:

When you eat:
1️⃣ Leptin rises from fat cells
2️⃣ Activates POMC neurons in hypothalamus
3️⃣ POMC releases α-MSH
4️⃣ α-MSH binds MC4R
5️⃣ MC4R signals "STOP EATING"

MC4R is the final step. When it's deficient, the "I'm full" signal never arrives.

Normal MC4R Function:

✅ Appropriate hunger/satiety regulation
✅ Normal energy expenditure
✅ Standard weight management
✅ Typical meal portions satisfy
✅ Natural appetite suppression after eating

MC4R Deficiency (2-6% of severely obese):

⚠️ Severe early-onset obesity (childhood)
⚠️ Hyperphagia (constant, insatiable hunger)
⚠️ Increased linear growth (often tall)
⚠️ Hyperinsulinemia
⚠️ Never feel satisfied after meals
⚠️ Willpower is NOT the problem

Treatment Breakthrough:

Setmelanotide (Imcivree) is FDA-approved for MC4R pathway deficiencies. It works downstream to restore the satiety signal. Life-changing for affected individuals.

Genetics matter. Obesity is not always about willpower.
