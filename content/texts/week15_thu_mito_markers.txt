📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: MITOCHONDRIAL HEALTH MARKERS

Your mitochondria produce 90% of your energy. When they fail, everything fails. But how do you measure something inside your cells?

Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in virtually every chronic disease: heart failure, diabetes, neurodegeneration, cancer, aging itself. Testing is challenging but possible.

Blood & Urine Markers:

🔬 Lactate/Pyruvate Ratio
Elevated ratio suggests impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Classic marker of mitochondrial dysfunction.

🔬 CoQ10 Levels
Essential electron carrier. Low levels indicate impaired ETC function. Declines with age and statin use.

🔬 NAD+/NADH Ratio
NAD+ is the central metabolic cofactor. The ratio reflects cellular energy state and redox balance.

🔬 Organic Acids Test (OAT)
Urinary metabolites from citric acid cycle. Abnormal patterns can pinpoint specific ETC complex dysfunction.

🔬 Carnitine Profile
Carnitine transports fatty acids into mitochondria. Abnormalities suggest fatty acid oxidation problems.

🔬 Amino Acid Panel
Certain patterns (elevated alanine, branched-chains) suggest mitochondrial issues.

Functional Tests:

⚡ VO2 Max Testing
Peak oxygen consumption reflects whole-body mitochondrial capacity.

⚡ PBMC Respirometry
Measures oxygen consumption in blood cells. Research tool becoming more available.

⚡ Muscle Biopsy
Gold standard but invasive. Reserved for serious suspected mitochondrial disease.

⚡ mtDNA Copy Number
Low copy number associated with aging and disease.

The insight: We can now assess mitochondrial function indirectly through accessible tests—and track whether interventions (CoQ10, NAD+ precursors, exercise) are working.
