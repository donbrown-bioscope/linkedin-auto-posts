💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: THERAPEUTIC PLASMA EXCHANGE

What if you could filter out the accumulated damage in your blood?

Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) removes your plasma—along with inflammatory proteins, autoantibodies, and age-related factors—and replaces it with fresh albumin.

The Science:

Young blood makes old mice younger. Old blood makes young mice older.

This isn't vampire mythology—it's published in Nature and Cell.

Researchers found that diluting old plasma (not adding young factors) was sufficient to rejuvenate tissues in aged mice:
→ Improved muscle repair
→ Enhanced liver function
→ Better brain health markers

The Procedure:

🩸 Blood is drawn and separated
🔄 Plasma is removed (containing inflammatory factors)
💧 Replaced with albumin solution
⏱️ Takes 2-3 hours per session

What's Being Removed:

→ Inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α)
→ Senescence-associated factors
→ Autoantibodies
→ AGEs (advanced glycation end products)
→ Accumulated metabolic waste

Current Applications:

✓ FDA-approved for autoimmune conditions
✓ Being studied for neurodegeneration
✓ Explored in longevity medicine clinics
✓ Some biohackers doing "young plasma" exchanges

The Frontier:

This is early—but the principle is sound. Aging may partly be an accumulation of harmful circulating factors. Periodically "cleaning" the blood could be a powerful intervention.
