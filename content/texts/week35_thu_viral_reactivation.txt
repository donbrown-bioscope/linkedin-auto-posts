📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: VIRAL REACTIVATION (EBV, CMV, HSV)

The viruses that never leave. Most adults carry dormant herpesviruses that can reactivate during stress or immune dysfunction—driving chronic fatigue and autoimmunity.

Common Latent Viruses:

🦠 EBV (Epstein-Barr)
95% of adults infected. Linked to chronic fatigue, MS, lymphoma, autoimmunity.

🦠 CMV (Cytomegalovirus)
60-90% infected. Accelerates immune aging. Linked to cardiovascular disease.

🦠 HSV-1/HSV-2
Cold sores/genital herpes. Linked to Alzheimer's risk (HSV-1).

🦠 VZV (Varicella-Zoster)
Chickenpox virus. Reactivates as shingles.

🦠 HHV-6/HHV-7
Nearly universal. Linked to MS, CFS, thyroid disease.

Reactivation Triggers:

→ Chronic stress
→ Poor sleep
→ Immune suppression
→ Other infections
→ Nutrient deficiency
→ Surgery/trauma
→ Hormonal changes
→ Aging

Testing:

🔬 IgG = past exposure
🔬 IgM = acute infection
🔬 Early Antigen (EA) = reactivation
🔬 PCR = active viral load

High EBV EA IgG suggests reactivation and may explain chronic symptoms.
