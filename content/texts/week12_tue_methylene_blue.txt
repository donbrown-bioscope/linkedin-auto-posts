💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: METHYLENE BLUE

A 150-year-old dye that acts as an alternative electron carrier—bypassing damaged mitochondrial complexes to restore energy production.

Methylene blue was the first synthetic drug ever used in medicine (1891, for malaria). Now it's being rediscovered for its remarkable effects on mitochondrial function.

How It Works:

⚡ Alternative Electron Carrier
When Complex I or III are damaged (common in aging), electrons get stuck. Methylene blue can shuttle electrons around the blockage, restoring ATP production.

🛡️ Auto-Recycling Antioxidant
MB cycles between oxidized (blue) and reduced (colorless) forms, continuously neutralizing free radicals. Unlike vitamin C that gets "used up," MB regenerates.

🧠 Neuroprotective
Enhances memory consolidation, protects against neurodegeneration, improves brain energy metabolism.

Benefits:

🔋 Enhanced ATP production
🧠 Improved cognitive function
😊 Mood support (early antidepressant effects)
🔥 Reduced inflammation
✨ Potential anti-aging effects

Important Considerations:

⚠️ Use pharmaceutical-grade only (USP)
⚠️ Low dose: 0.5-4 mg/kg
⚠️ Contraindicated with SSRIs (serotonin syndrome risk)
⚠️ Contraindicated in G6PD deficiency
⚠️ Will turn urine blue—this is normal and harmless

Higher doses are actually harmful—MB follows a hormetic curve. More is NOT better.

The key insight: Methylene blue doesn't just scavenge free radicals after they're formed—it makes mitochondria work better so fewer are produced in the first place.
