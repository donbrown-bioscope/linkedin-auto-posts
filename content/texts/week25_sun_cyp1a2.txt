🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: CYP1A2

Are you a fast or slow caffeine metabolizer? CYP1A2 determines if coffee is heart-protective or heart-risky for YOU specifically.

CYP1A2 is responsible for ~95% of caffeine metabolism. Your genotype determines how quickly you clear caffeine from your system.

Fast Metabolizers (AA genotype):

⚡ ~50% of population
⚡ Clear caffeine quickly (half-life ~3 hours)
⚡ Coffee REDUCES heart attack risk
⚡ Can drink coffee later in day
⚡ 2-4 cups daily may be cardioprotective

Slow Metabolizers (AC or CC):

🐢 ~50% of population
🐢 Caffeine lingers (half-life 5-10+ hours)
🐢 Coffee INCREASES heart attack risk (2-4x with >2 cups)
🐢 Should limit to 1-2 cups
🐢 No caffeine after noon

Other CYP1A2 Substrates:

CYP1A2 metabolizes more than caffeine:
→ Melatonin (slow metabolizers may need less)
→ Theophylline (asthma medication)
→ Some antidepressants
→ Carcinogens from grilled meat (HCAs)

Slow metabolizers have higher exposure to all CYP1A2 substrates—including dietary carcinogens.

Know your genotype. Personalize your coffee intake.
