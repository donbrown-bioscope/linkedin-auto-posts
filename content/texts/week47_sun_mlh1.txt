🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: MLH1

The DNA repair gene. MLH1 mutations cause Lynch syndrome—the most common hereditary cancer syndrome, raising risk for multiple cancers.

What MLH1 Does:

MLH1 is part of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system that fixes replication errors.

Without it, mutations accumulate rapidly.

Lynch syndrome (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 mutations) causes high risk for multiple cancers.

Cancer Risks (Lifetime):

🔴 Colorectal: 50-80%
🔴 Endometrial: 40-60%
🔴 Ovarian: 10-15%
🔴 Gastric: 5-10%
🔴 Plus: Urinary tract, brain, skin, others

Screening Protocol:

🔬 Lynch carriers:
→ Colonoscopy every 1-2 years from age 20-25
→ Consider prophylactic hysterectomy after childbearing
→ Aspirin reduces colorectal cancer risk
→ Cascade testing for family members essential
→ Genetic counseling critical

Early detection saves lives.
