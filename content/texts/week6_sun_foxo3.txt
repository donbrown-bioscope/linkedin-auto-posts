🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: FOXO3

If there's one gene that deserves the title "longevity gene," it's FOXO3.

It's the only gene consistently linked to exceptional longevity across multiple human populations—Japanese, German, Italian, Chinese, American, Jewish...

Centenarians are 2.7x more likely to carry the protective G allele.

What does FOXO3 do?

It's a master regulator that controls:
♻️ Autophagy — cellular cleanup
🛡️ Antioxidant defense — SOD, catalase production
🔧 DNA repair — fixing daily damage
⚖️ Metabolic regulation — glucose and lipid balance
🚫 Tumor suppression — keeping cells in check

The variants:

🛡️ G Allele (Protective) — 25-30% of population
Enhanced stress resistance and cellular maintenance

📊 T Allele (Common) — 70-75% of population
Standard FOXO3 activity

Here's the good news if you don't have the G allele:

FOXO3 activity can be enhanced through lifestyle:
→ Fasting / caloric restriction
→ Exercise
→ Resveratrol and other polyphenols
→ Cold exposure

The G allele carriers may have a head start, but everyone can activate this pathway.

Know your FOXO3 status. Then optimize accordingly.
