💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: FISETIN

The most potent natural senolytic discovered. Fisetin selectively kills senescent "zombie" cells that accumulate with age and drive inflammation.

What Are Senescent Cells?

Senescent cells are damaged cells that refuse to die. Instead, they:
→ Secrete inflammatory factors (SASP)
→ Damage neighboring healthy cells
→ Accumulate with age
→ Drive tissue dysfunction
→ Accelerate aging

Fisetin is a senolytic—it selectively eliminates these zombie cells.

Natural Sources:

🍓 Strawberries (highest concentration)
🍎 Apples
🍊 Persimmons
🧅 Onions

Key Benefits:

🧟 Senolytic activity (clears senescent cells)
🧠 Neuroprotection
🔥 Anti-inflammatory
🛡️ Potent antioxidant

Dosing Approaches:

→ Intermittent high-dose: 500-1500mg for 2-3 days monthly
→ Continuous low-dose: 100-500mg daily
→ Often combined with quercetin for synergy

Emerging research suggests fisetin may extend healthspan by reducing the burden of senescent cells.
