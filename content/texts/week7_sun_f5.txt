🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: FACTOR V LEIDEN

The most common inherited clotting disorder.

5% of Caucasians carry it. Most have no idea—until their first blood clot.

Factor V Leiden is a mutation in the F5 gene that makes Factor V resistant to inactivation. The result: blood that clots too easily.

The risk breakdown:

✓ No mutation (~95%)
Baseline clot risk

⚠️ Heterozygous (~5%)
5-7x increased DVT/PE risk

🚨 Homozygous (~0.02%)
50-80x increased DVT/PE risk

Why this matters:

Most carriers go their entire lives without a clot. But add a trigger, and everything changes.

Risk amplifiers (these stack):

💊 Oral contraceptives → 35x risk (with FVL)
✈️ Long flights → Stasis + FVL = danger
🏥 Surgery → Immobilization triggers clots
🤰 Pregnancy → Hypercoagulable state
🚬 Smoking → Vascular damage + FVL

A woman with undiagnosed Factor V Leiden who starts birth control pills has 35x the clot risk of someone without it.

The prevention opportunity:

Knowing your status enables:
→ Aspirin for travel
→ Compression stockings for flights
→ Alternative contraception choices
→ Extra vigilance during surgery/pregnancy
→ Lower threshold for anticoagulation if needed

This is exactly what precision medicine is for. A simple genetic test that could prevent a devastating pulmonary embolism.
