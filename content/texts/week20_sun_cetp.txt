🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: CETP

Centenarians are enriched for CETP variants that give them naturally high HDL. This gene may be a key to exceptional longevity.

CETP (Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein) shuttles cholesterol between lipoproteins. It transfers cholesterol from "good" HDL to "bad" LDL/VLDL particles.

What CETP Does:

1️⃣ HDL picks up cholesterol from tissues
2️⃣ CETP transfers this cholesterol to LDL/VLDL
3️⃣ Result: HDL decreases, LDL increases

Less CETP activity = Higher HDL, lower LDL

The Longevity Connection:

Studies of Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians found:
→ Enrichment for CETP loss-of-function variants
→ HDL levels 30-50% higher than average
→ Larger, more functional HDL particles
→ Better reverse cholesterol transport

These are people who live to 100+ with good health—and they're born with this advantage.

Clinical Implications:

✓ Low CETP Activity (Protective):
Higher HDL, larger particles, better cardiovascular profile. Associated with longevity.

⚠️ High CETP Activity (Common):
Lower HDL, more cholesterol transferred to atherogenic particles. Standard cardiovascular risk.

Drug Development Note:

CETP inhibitors were developed to raise HDL, but clinical trials had mixed results. Turns out the genetic protection involves more than just HDL numbers—it's about HDL function.
