🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: PAI-1

The clot stabilizer gene. PAI-1 4G/4G variant increases thrombosis risk AND metabolic syndrome—a dual cardiovascular threat.

What PAI-1 Does:

PAI-1 inhibits plasminogen activators, preventing clot breakdown.

High PAI-1 levels = clots persist longer.

Also linked to:
→ Obesity
→ Insulin resistance
→ Cardiovascular disease

The 4G variant causes higher PAI-1 expression.

Key Variants:

✅ 5G/5G (Lower Risk) - ~25% of population
• Lower PAI-1 levels
• Better clot resolution
• Lower metabolic risk

⚠️ 4G/4G (Higher Risk) - ~25% of population
• Higher PAI-1 levels
• Increased thrombosis risk
• Metabolic syndrome link

Clinical Implications:

4G/4G + obesity = significantly elevated cardiovascular risk.

Interventions:
→ Weight loss (dramatically reduces PAI-1)
→ Low-dose aspirin
→ Omega-3 fatty acids
→ Aggressive metabolic optimization
