🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: OPRM1

The pain and reward receptor gene. OPRM1 variants affect pain sensitivity, opioid dosing requirements, and addiction vulnerability.

OPRM1 encodes the mu-opioid receptor—the primary target of opioid pain medications and endogenous endorphins.

A118G Polymorphism:

A/A (Common):
✅ Normal receptor function
✅ Standard opioid response
✅ Typical pain sensitivity
✅ Standard naltrexone response
✅ Baseline addiction risk

G Carriers (A/G, G/G):
⚠️ Reduced receptor binding
⚠️ Need higher opioid doses (30-50% more)
⚠️ Increased pain sensitivity
⚠️ Better naltrexone response
⚠️ Higher addiction risk
⚠️ Less natural endorphin effect

Clinical Implications:

Pain Management:
→ G carriers often require higher morphine/fentanyl doses
→ May appear "drug-seeking" when undertreated
→ Alternative pain strategies may be preferable

Addiction Treatment:
→ G carriers respond better to naltrexone (Vivitrol)
→ Important for medication-assisted treatment selection

Knowing your OPRM1 status helps personalize both pain management and addiction prevention strategies.
