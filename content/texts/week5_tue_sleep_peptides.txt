💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: SLEEP PEPTIDES
🧬 Peptide Series

Your pineal gland shrinks with age.

By 60, you're producing a fraction of the melatonin you made at 20. Most people reach for melatonin supplements—but there's a problem:

Supplementing melatonin can further suppress your own production.

What if you could restore the machinery instead?

🌙 EPITALON (Epithalamin)
A tetrapeptide originally isolated from the pineal gland:
→ Reactivates endogenous melatonin production
→ Activates telomerase (yes, really)
→ Restores circadian rhythm function
→ Studied for 35+ years with remarkable safety data

😴 DSIP (Delta Sleep-Inducing Peptide)
A nonapeptide that enhances sleep architecture:
→ Increases slow-wave (deep) sleep
→ Reduces time to fall asleep
→ Modulates stress hormones
→ No morning grogginess like sedatives

The key insight: Restore vs. Replace

Melatonin supplements = temporary fix that may worsen the underlying problem

Sleep peptides = address the root cause by rejuvenating the system itself

This is the precision medicine approach to sleep—not masking symptoms, but restoring function.
