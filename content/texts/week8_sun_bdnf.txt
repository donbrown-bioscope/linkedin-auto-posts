🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: BDNF

They call it the brain's "Miracle-Gro."

BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) is essential for:
→ Growing new neurons
→ Forming memories
→ Learning new skills
→ Protecting existing brain cells
→ Recovering from brain injury

And 30% of people carry a variant that affects how they produce it.

The Val66Met Polymorphism:

🧠 Val/Val (G/G) — 60-70%
→ Normal BDNF secretion
→ Efficient memory formation
→ Standard exercise-to-BDNF response
→ Better antidepressant response

⚡ Val/Met or Met/Met — 30-40%
→ Reduced activity-dependent BDNF release
→ Smaller hippocampus on average
→ May need MORE exercise for same brain benefit
→ Higher depression risk... BUT also higher response to interventions

The surprising twist:

Met carriers aren't disadvantaged—they're more responsive.

The same lifestyle changes that slightly benefit Val/Val carriers produce larger relative increases in Met carriers.

If you're Met/Met, you need BDNF-boosting activities more—but you also respond more.

Natural BDNF Boosters:

🏃 Aerobic exercise (strongest effect)
😴 Deep sleep
☀️ Sunlight exposure
🍽️ Intermittent fasting
🧘 Meditation and mindfulness

Know your BDNF genotype. Then optimize your protocol accordingly.
