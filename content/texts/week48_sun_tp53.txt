🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: TP53

The guardian of the genome. TP53 mutations cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome—near 100% lifetime cancer risk across multiple cancer types.

What TP53 Does:

P53 is the most important tumor suppressor.

It detects DNA damage and either:
→ Repairs it
→ Halts cell division
→ Triggers apoptosis (cell death)

Called "guardian of the genome."

Mutated in 50%+ of all human cancers.

Li-Fraumeni = inherited TP53 mutation.

Associated Cancers:

🎗️ Breast
🎗️ Sarcoma
🎗️ Brain
🎗️ Leukemia
🎗️ Adrenal
🎗️ Lung
🎗️ Colon
🎗️ Many more

Screening Protocol:

⚠️ Li-Fraumeni carriers:
→ Annual whole-body MRI
→ Breast MRI
→ Colonoscopy
→ Blood counts
→ Avoid radiation when possible

Risk: 50% cancer by age 30, 90%+ lifetime.

Genetic counseling and cascade testing essential.
