💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: METFORMIN

A 100-year-old diabetes drug that may extend lifespan. Diabetics on metformin outlive non-diabetics not on it. The TAME trial aims to prove it.

Metformin was derived from French lilac (Galega officinalis), used medicinally since medieval times. It's been the first-line diabetes drug for decades. Now it's being investigated for longevity.

Longevity Mechanisms:

⚡ AMPK Activation — Master metabolic switch
🎯 mTOR Inhibition — Mimics caloric restriction
🔥 Reduced Inflammation — Lowers IL-6, CRP
📉 Lower Insulin/IGF-1 — Longevity-associated
🦠 Microbiome Effects — Beneficial changes
🧬 Epigenetic Modifications — Slows epigenetic aging
🔋 Mitochondrial Complex I — Mild inhibition, hormetic
🎗️ Reduced Cancer Risk — Consistent finding

Key Evidence:

📊 UK Study (2014): Type 2 diabetics on metformin lived LONGER than matched non-diabetics. This shouldn't happen—diabetes shortens life.

📊 Multiple studies show 20-30% reduced cancer incidence in metformin users.

📊 TAME Trial (ongoing): Testing metformin vs. placebo in healthy 65-79 year olds for effects on aging-related diseases.

Dosing for Longevity:

Typical: 500-1000mg, 1-2x daily
Extended-release better tolerated
Take with food to reduce GI side effects

Considerations:

⚠️ May blunt some exercise adaptations (hypertrophy)
⚠️ Depletes B12 (supplement recommended)
⚠️ GI side effects common initially
⚠️ Not ideal for athletes focused on muscle building

The bottom line: Metformin is the closest thing we have to a proven, widely available longevity drug. Cheap, safe, 60+ years of human data.
