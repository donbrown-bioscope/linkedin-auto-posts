💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: PEMF THERAPY

Pulsed Electromagnetic Field therapy. FDA-cleared for bone healing and depression. Emerging evidence for pain, inflammation, and cellular regeneration.

How PEMF Works:

PEMF devices generate low-frequency electromagnetic pulses that penetrate tissues. These fields influence:
→ Cell membrane potential
→ Calcium signaling
→ ATP production
→ Cellular repair mechanisms

Used by NASA for astronaut bone loss. FDA-approved for non-union fractures since 1979.

Key Benefits:

🦴 Bone healing (FDA-cleared)
😌 Pain relief
🔥 Inflammation reduction
😴 Sleep quality improvement
🧠 Depression (TMS devices)
💪 Enhanced recovery
🔋 ATP production
🩹 Wound healing

FDA-Cleared Devices:

→ Bone growth stimulators
→ TMS for depression (Brainsway, Neurostar)

Consumer devices:
→ BEMER, Pulsed Harmonix, FlexPulse

Research ongoing for many applications.
