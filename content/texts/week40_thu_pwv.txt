📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: PULSE WAVE VELOCITY

Measure your vascular age. PWV assesses arterial stiffness—a powerful predictor of cardiovascular events independent of blood pressure.

What Is PWV?

Pulse Wave Velocity measures how fast the pressure wave travels through your arteries.

Stiffer arteries = faster wave = higher PWV

It's like measuring the "hardness" of your blood vessels. Gold standard marker of vascular aging.

PWV Values:

✅ Normal: < 8 m/s
Young, flexible arteries. Low CV risk.

⚠️ Elevated: 8-10 m/s
Early stiffening. Optimize risk factors.

🚨 High: > 10 m/s
Significant stiffness. Higher CV risk.

How to Improve PWV:

💪 Exercise (especially aerobic)
🩸 Blood pressure control
🧂 Reduce sodium
🍌 Increase potassium
🐟 Omega-3 fatty acids
🔥 Reduce inflammation
🚭 Avoid smoking
🍷 Limit alcohol

The Good News:

PWV is modifiable! Unlike CAC which can only be stabilized, arterial stiffness can actually improve with intervention.

Track progress over time.
