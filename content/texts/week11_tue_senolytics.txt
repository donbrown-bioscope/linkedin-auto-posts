💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: SENOLYTICS

Zombie cells accumulate with age, secreting inflammatory signals that damage neighbors. Senolytics selectively kill these cells—and rejuvenate tissue.

Senescent cells are damaged cells that refuse to die. Instead of undergoing apoptosis, they enter a state of "living death" and pump out inflammatory cytokines (the SASP: Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype).

By age 60, you may have 100x more senescent cells than at age 20. They accumulate in every tissue and drive aging.

The D+Q Protocol (Dasatinib + Quercetin):

🧪 Dasatinib
→ Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (leukemia drug)
→ Targets senescent cell survival pathways
→ Particularly effective in fat tissue

🧪 Quercetin
→ Natural flavonoid (found in apples, onions)
→ Synergizes with Dasatinib
→ Hits different senescent cell types

Together, they clear senescent cells that neither could alone.

The Remarkable Feature: Intermittent Dosing

Unlike drugs you take daily, senolytics work with hit-and-run dosing:
→ Take for 3 days
→ Wait weeks to months
→ Repeat

Why? Senescent cells don't regenerate quickly. Once you clear them, they take months to re-accumulate.

Human Evidence (Mayo Clinic 2019):

First human trial showed D+Q reduced senescent cell markers in patients with diabetic kidney disease after just 3 doses.

Benefits seen:
→ Reduced senescent cell burden
→ Improved physical function
→ Reduced inflammatory markers

This is early but profound—we may be able to periodically "clean" aging cells.
