🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: HLA-B*27

The strongest genetic link to autoimmune disease. If you have chronic back pain before 40, this gene could explain why.

HLA-B27 is a human leukocyte antigen—part of your immune system's identification system. About 8% of Caucasians carry it.

The problem: HLA-B27 is strongly associated with a group of inflammatory conditions called spondyloarthropathies.

Associated Conditions:

🦴 Ankylosing Spondylitis
90% of patients are HLA-B27 positive
Inflammatory back pain, spinal fusion

👁️ Acute Anterior Uveitis
50% are HLA-B27 positive
Sudden eye inflammation

🦠 Reactive Arthritis
60-80% are HLA-B27 positive
Arthritis after infection

🫁 Psoriatic Arthritis
20% are HLA-B27 positive
Joint inflammation with psoriasis

The Numbers:

→ 8% of Caucasians carry HLA-B27
→ Only 5-20% of carriers develop disease
→ Average delay to AS diagnosis: 7 years

Why Knowing Matters:

Most people with HLA-B27 never develop disease—so having it doesn't mean you're destined for problems.

But if you have:
→ Inflammatory back pain (worse with rest, better with movement)
→ Morning stiffness lasting >30 minutes
→ Eye inflammation episodes
→ Onset before age 40

...then knowing your HLA-B27 status can speed diagnosis by years. Early treatment prevents irreversible spinal damage.
