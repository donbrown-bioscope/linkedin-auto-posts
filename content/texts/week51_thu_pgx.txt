📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: PHARMACOGENOMICS PANEL

The right drug at the right dose. Pharmacogenomics testing predicts how YOU will respond to medications—avoiding adverse reactions and treatment failures.

Key Genes:

🧬 CYP2D6: Codeine, antidepressants, tamoxifen
🧬 CYP2C19: Plavix, PPIs, antidepressants
🧬 CYP2C9: Warfarin, NSAIDs, sulfonylureas
🧬 CYP3A4: Statins, calcium blockers, many drugs
🧬 SLCO1B1: Statin myopathy risk
🧬 VKORC1: Warfarin sensitivity
🧬 HLA-B*5701: Abacavir hypersensitivity
🧬 DPYD: 5-FU toxicity risk

Why It Matters:

7% of FDA-approved drugs have PGx labeling.

Poor metabolizers may need lower doses.
Ultra-rapid metabolizers may need higher doses or different drugs.

One test, lifetime guidance.

Testing Options:

🔬 Panels: GeneSight, Genomind, RightMed, OneOme
🔬 Cost: $200-400 (often covered by insurance)
