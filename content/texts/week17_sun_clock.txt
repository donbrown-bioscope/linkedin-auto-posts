🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: CLOCK

The master timekeeper of your biology. CLOCK variants determine if you're a night owl or early bird—and affect metabolism, mood, and disease risk.

CLOCK (Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput) is a core circadian rhythm gene. It regulates 24-hour cycles in virtually every tissue.

What CLOCK Controls Throughout the Day:

⏰ 6-9 AM: Cortisol surge, alertness, blood pressure rise
⏰ 10 AM-2 PM: Peak cognition, best for complex tasks
⏰ 3-6 PM: Best physical performance, reaction time
⏰ 9 PM-12 AM: Melatonin release, repair mode, growth hormone

CLOCK Variants & Chronotype:

The CLOCK 3111T/C variant shifts circadian preference:
→ T/T carriers: More likely morning types
→ C carriers: Evening types (night owls)

Evening types have higher rates of:
→ Obesity and metabolic syndrome
→ Depression
→ Sleep disorders
→ Cardiovascular disease

The Clinical Relevance:

Understanding your chronotype allows optimization of:
→ Meal timing (eating aligned with your clock)
→ Exercise timing (based on your performance peak)
→ Work schedules (matching cognitive demands)
→ Medication timing (chronopharmacology)

Fighting your biology is a losing battle. Work with your clock, not against it.
