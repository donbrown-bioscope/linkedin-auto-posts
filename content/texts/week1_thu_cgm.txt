📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING

Your fasting glucose is "normal." Your A1c is fine.

But what happens after meals? During sleep? After that "healthy" smoothie?

You have no idea—unless you wear a CGM.

Continuous Glucose Monitoring reveals what blood tests miss:

📈 Post-meal spikes that drive inflammation
📉 Nighttime drops that disrupt sleep
🎢 Glycemic variability—the hidden damage

What CGM Teaches You:

🍚 That "healthy" oatmeal? Might spike you to 180 mg/dL
🥗 That salad with dressing? Perhaps only 110 mg/dL
🏃 A 10-minute walk after eating? Cuts the spike in half
😴 Poor sleep → worse glucose control the next day

The Insights Are Personal:

Two people eating identical meals can have completely different responses. Your microbiome, genetics, sleep, stress, and fitness all affect YOUR glucose response.

CGM reveals YOUR patterns—not population averages.

What Optimal Looks Like:

→ Fasting: 70-90 mg/dL
→ Post-meal peak: <140 mg/dL (ideally <120)
→ Time to baseline: <2 hours
→ Variability: Minimal swings throughout day

This isn't just for diabetics. Metabolic dysfunction begins decades before diagnosis. CGM catches it early—when it's still reversible.
