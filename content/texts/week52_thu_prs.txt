📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: POLYGENIC RISK SCORES

Beyond single genes. Polygenic risk scores combine thousands of genetic variants to predict disease risk—the future of precision prevention.

What Are Polygenic Risk Scores?

Most diseases aren't caused by single genes but thousands of variants with small effects.

PRS aggregates these into one risk score.

High PRS = higher disease risk, earlier onset, more aggressive disease.

Low PRS = some protection even with family history.

Complements traditional risk factors.

Diseases with Validated PRS:

🫀 CAD / Heart Disease
🍬 Type 2 Diabetes
🎗️ Breast Cancer
🎗️ Prostate Cancer
🧠 Alzheimer's
💓 Atrial Fibrillation
⚖️ Obesity
🧠 Schizophrenia

Services & Utility:

🔬 Providers: 23andMe, Genomics plc, Myriad, Ambry
🔬 Top 1% PRS for CAD has 3-5x risk vs average
🔬 Actionable: Earlier screening, aggressive prevention
🔬 Limitation: Less validated in non-European ancestry
