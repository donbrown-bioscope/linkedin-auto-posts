🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: ADRB2

Your bronchodilator response gene. ADRB2 variants affect asthma medication effectiveness and athletic endurance performance.

ADRB2 (Beta-2 Adrenergic Receptor) has dual relevance:

Respiratory Function:

🫁 Bronchodilation (opens airways)
🫁 Target of beta-agonist inhalers
🫁 Asthma/COPD treatment response
🫁 Albuterol, salmeterol sensitivity

Athletic Performance:

🏃 Muscle blood flow regulation
🏃 Fat mobilization
🏃 Endurance capacity
🏃 Recovery from exercise

Key Variants:

Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu affect receptor function:

→ Gly16 variant = faster receptor desensitization
→ May need alternative asthma therapies
→ Reduced long-term response to beta-agonists

→ Arg16 variant = better sustained response
→ Good candidate for beta-agonist therapy

Clinical Implications:

If you have Gly16 and use albuterol frequently:
• May experience reduced effectiveness over time
• Consider leukotriene inhibitors or inhaled steroids
• Pharmacogenomic testing guides optimal therapy

Know your genotype for personalized respiratory care.
