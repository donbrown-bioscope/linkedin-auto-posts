🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: LDLR

The cholesterol clearance gene. LDLR mutations cause sky-high LDL from birth—dramatically accelerating atherosclerosis.

What LDLR Does:

LDLR receptors on liver cells remove LDL particles from blood.

Mutations reduce receptor function, causing LDL to accumulate.

FH (Familial Hypercholesterolemia) affects 1 in 250 people—one of the most common genetic disorders.

Often undiagnosed until heart attack.

Types:

⚠️ Heterozygous FH (1 copy):
• LDL 190-400+ mg/dL
• Heart disease 10-20 years early
• Affects 1 in 250

⚠️ Homozygous FH (2 copies):
• LDL 400-1000+ mg/dL
• Heart disease in childhood
• Affects 1 in 250,000

Treatment:

💊 High-intensity statins + ezetimibe
💊 PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab, alirocumab)
💊 Target LDL < 70 (or < 55 with CVD)
💊 Screen family members—50% affected
