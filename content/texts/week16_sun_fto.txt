🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: FTO

The first "obesity gene" discovered. 45% of Europeans carry risk variants. They feel hungrier, crave more fat, and gain weight more easily.

FTO (Fat Mass and Obesity-Associated) was identified in 2007 as the first gene robustly linked to common obesity. It affects appetite regulation, not metabolism.

Weight Impact by Genotype (rs9939609):

T/T → Baseline (lower obesity risk)
A/T → +1.5 kg average weight, intermediate risk
A/A → +3 kg average weight, 1.7x obesity risk

The A allele is remarkably common—carried by ~45% of Europeans.

What FTO Actually Does:

FTO affects:
→ Ghrelin levels (hunger hormone)
→ Food reward circuitry in the brain
→ Satiety signaling
→ Preference for high-fat, high-calorie foods

Carriers don't have "slow metabolism." They have increased appetite and reduced satiety. They feel hungrier and less satisfied after eating.

The Good News:

🏃 Exercise reduces FTO's effect by 27%
Physical activity attenuates the genetic risk significantly.

🥩 High-protein diets help
Protein is more satiating for FTO carriers.

📊 Knowing your status enables targeted strategies
If you're A/A, you know you need to be more deliberate about appetite management.

The Broader Point:

FTO shows that obesity has a genetic component—but it's not destiny. The gene creates a predisposition that environment and behavior can override.

Those who struggle with weight despite "trying hard" may have legitimate biological differences, not lack of willpower.
