📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: FOOD SENSITIVITY VS ALLERGY

Not the same thing. Food allergies are IgE-mediated and potentially deadly. Food sensitivities are IgG-mediated and cause delayed, chronic symptoms.

Food Allergy (IgE-Mediated):

⚠️ Immediate reaction (minutes)
⚠️ Can be life-threatening
⚠️ Anaphylaxis possible
⚠️ Hives, swelling, breathing issues
⚠️ Small amount triggers
⚠️ Usually lifelong
⚠️ Common: peanuts, shellfish, eggs

Food Sensitivity (IgG-Mediated):

🔶 Delayed reaction (hours to days)
🔶 Not life-threatening
🔶 Chronic symptoms
🔶 Fatigue, brain fog, joint pain
🔶 Dose-dependent
🔶 Often reversible
🔶 Gut healing may resolve

Food Intolerance:

✅ Not immune-mediated
✅ Enzyme deficiency
✅ Example: lactose intolerance
✅ GI symptoms primarily
✅ Enzyme replacement helps

Testing Options:

🔬 IgE panels (true allergy)
🔬 IgG food panels
🔬 Elimination diet (gold standard)
🔬 MRT/LEAP testing
🔬 Skin prick tests

Food sensitivities often resolve after removing triggers, healing the gut, and reintroducing foods carefully.
