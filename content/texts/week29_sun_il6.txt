🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: IL6

The "dual-personality" cytokine. IL6 can be pro-inflammatory OR anti-inflammatory depending on context. Variants affect your baseline inflammatory state.

IL6 (Interleukin 6) is a fascinating cytokine that plays both beneficial and harmful roles:

Beneficial Roles (Acute):

✅ Muscle repair after exercise
✅ Immune activation against infection
✅ Metabolic regulation
✅ Tissue regeneration

Harmful Roles (Chronic Elevation):

⚠️ Chronic inflammation marker
⚠️ Cardiovascular disease risk
⚠️ Insulin resistance
⚠️ Depression and fatigue link
⚠️ Accelerated aging

Key Genetic Variant:

IL6 -174G>C polymorphism affects baseline IL6 production:
→ CC genotype = lower IL6, potentially longer lifespan
→ GG genotype = higher IL6, greater inflammatory response

Clinical Relevance:

High IL6 is associated with:
• Heart disease progression
• Type 2 diabetes
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• Major depression
• Frailty in aging

Testing IL6 levels provides insight into inflammatory status.
