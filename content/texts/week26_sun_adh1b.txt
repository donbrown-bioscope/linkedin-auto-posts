🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: ADH1B

Why do some people flush red after one drink? ADH1B determines how fast you convert alcohol to acetaldehyde—a toxic carcinogen.

The Alcohol Metabolism Pathway:

1️⃣ Alcohol (Ethanol) enters the body
2️⃣ ADH1B converts it to ACETALDEHYDE (toxic!)
3️⃣ ALDH2 clears the acetaldehyde
4️⃣ Safe metabolites excreted

The problem: Acetaldehyde is a Group 1 carcinogen. How long it lingers matters.

Fast ADH1B (*2 allele):

⚡ Common in East Asians (70-90%)
⚡ Rapidly produces acetaldehyde
⚡ Causes "Asian flush" (facial redness)
⚡ Protective against alcoholism (drinking is unpleasant)
⚡ BUT: Higher cancer risk if you drink anyway

Slow ADH1B (*1 allele):

🐢 Common in Europeans, Africans
🐢 Slower acetaldehyde production
🐢 Less immediate discomfort from drinking
🐢 Higher alcoholism risk
🐢 Can drink without flushing

The Double-Hit Problem:

Fast ADH1B + Slow ALDH2 = Acetaldehyde accumulates rapidly AND clears slowly. Maximum cancer risk. Common in East Asians. Even moderate drinking significantly increases esophageal and head/neck cancer risk.

Know your genes. Make informed choices.
