💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: TAURINE

The 2023 longevity breakthrough. Taurine supplementation extended healthy lifespan by 10-12% in mice. Taurine levels decline with age—supplementation restores youthful levels.

The Science (Singh et al. 2023, Science):

→ Taurine deficiency drives aging in mice, monkeys, and humans
→ Blood taurine levels drop 80% from youth to old age
→ Supplementation increased lifespan in mice
→ Improved muscle function
→ Reduced cellular senescence
→ Suppressed inflammation
→ Enhanced mitochondrial function

One of the strongest longevity interventions discovered.

Key Benefits:

❤️ Heart health (essential for cardiac function)
🧠 Neuroprotection
💪 Muscle function
👁️ Eye health (highest concentration in retina)
🔥 Anti-inflammatory
🔋 Mitochondrial support
🩸 Blood pressure regulation
📉 Blood sugar control

Dosing:

→ 1-3g daily typical dose
→ Found in meat, fish, shellfish
