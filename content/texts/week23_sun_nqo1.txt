🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: NQO1

A master detoxification enzyme. NQO1 protects against quinone toxins, recycles CoQ10, and determines how well you respond to certain supplements.

NQO1 (NAD(P)H Quinone Dehydrogenase 1) is a Phase II detox enzyme that performs two-electron reductions—safely neutralizing reactive quinones that would otherwise cause oxidative damage.

What NQO1 Does:

🧪 Detoxifies quinones (benzene metabolites, chemotherapy drugs)
🔄 Regenerates CoQ10 from ubiquinone to ubiquinol
🛡️ Stabilizes p53 tumor suppressor protein
⚡ Provides antioxidant protection
💊 Activates certain pro-drug compounds

NQO1*2 Variant (rs1800566):

🟢 C/C (Normal): Full NQO1 activity. Can activate CoQ10 efficiently. Responds to NQO1-dependent therapies.

🟡 C/T (Heterozygous): Reduced activity (~50%). Intermediate responses.

🔴 T/T (Null): NO functional NQO1 enzyme. 4-20% of population depending on ethnicity.

Null individuals:
→ Cannot efficiently recycle CoQ10
→ May not respond to NQO1-dependent therapies
→ Higher benzene toxicity risk
→ Need alternative antioxidant strategies
→ Should consider pre-reduced ubiquinol instead of ubiquinone

Know your NQO1 status to personalize your supplement strategy.
