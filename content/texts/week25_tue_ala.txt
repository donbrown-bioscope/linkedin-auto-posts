💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: ALPHA-LIPOIC ACID

The "universal antioxidant"—works in both water AND fat. Regenerates other antioxidants including vitamins C, E, and glutathione.

What Makes ALA Unique:

💧 Both water AND fat soluble (works everywhere in the body)
🔄 Recycles vitamins C, E, glutathione, and CoQ10
🧬 Chelates heavy metals (mercury, arsenic, cadmium)
🧠 Crosses blood-brain barrier (rare for antioxidants)

Clinical Applications:

📉 Blood sugar control (improves insulin sensitivity)
🦶 Diabetic neuropathy (FDA-approved in Europe)
🛡️ Liver protection (hepatoprotection)
🧠 Cognitive support (neuroprotection)
✨ Skin health (reduces fine lines)
⚡ Mitochondrial support
🔥 Anti-inflammatory effects
💪 Weight loss adjunct

Dosing Notes:

→ R-lipoic acid is the natural, more potent form
→ Racemic ALA (R+S) is common but less effective
→ 300-600mg daily typical dose
→ Take on empty stomach for best absorption
→ Na-R-ALA (stabilized) is most bioavailable

One of the most versatile antioxidants available.
