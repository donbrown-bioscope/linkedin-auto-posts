💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: CURCUMIN

Turmeric's golden compound has 10,000+ published studies. The challenge: bioavailability. Standard curcumin is 1% absorbed. Optimized forms change everything.

Curcumin is turmeric's active compound. The spice has been used medicinally for millennia, but getting therapeutic levels into your bloodstream is tricky.

Optimized Curcumin Forms:

🔬 Longvida® (SLCP)
65x more bioavailable. Gets free curcumin into brain. Best for neurological applications.

🔬 Meriva® (Phytosome)
29x absorption. Phospholipid complex. Best evidence for joint health.

🔬 Theracurmin®
27x absorption. Nano-particle technology. Good general option.

🔬 BCM-95® / Curcugreen®
7x absorption. Combined with turmeric essential oils. Cost-effective.

Mechanisms:

🔥 NF-κB inhibition (master inflammatory switch)
🦴 Joint health and comfort
🧠 Neuroprotection (crosses blood-brain barrier with Longvida)
❤️ Cardiovascular benefits
🦠 Gut health
🛡️ Antioxidant
😊 Mood support
🧬 Epigenetic modulation

Dosing:

Not all forms are equivalent:
→ Longvida: 400-500mg
→ Meriva: 500-1000mg
→ BCM-95: 500-1500mg
→ Standard curcumin: Mostly useless
