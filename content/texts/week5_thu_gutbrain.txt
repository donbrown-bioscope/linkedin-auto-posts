📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: THE GUT-BRAIN AXIS

Your gut makes 90% of your serotonin.

That "gut feeling" isn't just a metaphor—it's biology.

Depression. Anxiety. Brain fog. Mood swings.

We look to the brain for answers. But what if many of these issues start in your intestines?

The numbers are staggering:

🧠 500 million neurons in your enteric nervous system (more than your spinal cord)
🦠 39 trillion bacteria in your gut microbiome (more than human cells in your body)
🧪 90% of serotonin produced in the gut, not the brain
🛡️ 70% of immune cells reside in your gut

Four pathways connect gut to brain:

1️⃣ Vagus Nerve — Direct neural highway
2️⃣ Neurotransmitters — Gut bacteria produce serotonin, GABA, dopamine
3️⃣ Inflammation — Leaky gut → systemic inflammation → neuroinflammation
4️⃣ Immune Signaling — Cytokines that affect brain function

Emerging research links gut dysbiosis to:
→ Depression & anxiety
→ Parkinson's disease
→ Autism spectrum disorders
→ Alzheimer's disease

The implication? Mental health treatment may need to start with a stool test, not just a questionnaire.

Your second brain deserves as much attention as your first.
