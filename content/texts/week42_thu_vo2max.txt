📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: VO2 MAX TESTING

The single best predictor of longevity. VO2 max measures maximum oxygen uptake—the gold standard for cardiorespiratory fitness.

What Is VO2 Max?

VO2 max = maximum rate of oxygen consumption during maximal exercise.

Measured in mL/kg/min.

Higher = better cardiovascular health, lower all-cause mortality.

Each 1 mL/kg/min increase reduces mortality risk ~4%.

It's MODIFIABLE with training!

VO2 Max Values:

🔻 Low: < 30 mL/kg/min
High mortality risk. Significant improvement possible.

➡️ Average: 35-45 mL/kg/min
Population average. Room for improvement.

🔺 Elite: > 50-60 mL/kg/min
Excellent fitness. Athletes: 60-85+

How to Improve:

🏃 HIIT (most effective)
🚴 Zone 2 training (aerobic base)
📈 Progressive overload
📅 Consistency over intensity

Testing Options:

→ Clinical labs (gold standard)
→ PNOĒ metabolic analyzer
→ Garmin/Apple Watch estimates

Test annually to track progress.
