📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: ADRENAL HEALTH & HPA AXIS

"Adrenal fatigue" isn't quite right—but HPA axis dysregulation is real. Chronic stress rewires your stress response system, with profound health effects.

The HPA Axis (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal):

1️⃣ Hypothalamus senses stress → releases CRH
2️⃣ Pituitary responds → releases ACTH
3️⃣ Adrenals respond → release cortisol
4️⃣ Cortisol feeds back → inhibits HPA

This is supposed to be a short-term response. Chronic activation breaks the feedback loop.

Healthy Cortisol Pattern:

✅ Peak within 30 minutes of waking (CAR)
✅ Gradual decline through the day
✅ Lowest at bedtime and overnight
✅ Appropriate response to acute stress
✅ Efficient recovery after stressor ends

Dysregulated Patterns:

⚠️ Flat curve (blunted CAR) — "burned out"
⚠️ Elevated evening cortisol — can't wind down
⚠️ Reversed pattern — low morning, high evening
⚠️ Hyperactive response — overreacts to small stressors
⚠️ Poor recovery — cortisol stays elevated

Testing:

→ 4-point salivary cortisol (morning, noon, evening, bedtime)
→ DUTCH test (comprehensive hormone + cortisol metabolites)
→ Morning serum cortisol (limited snapshot)

Treatment targets the pattern, not just "raising" or "lowering" cortisol.
