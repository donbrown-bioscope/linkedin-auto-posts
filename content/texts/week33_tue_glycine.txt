💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: GLYCINE / COLLAGEN

The simplest amino acid with profound effects. Glycine extends lifespan in animal models, improves sleep, supports glutathione, and is the primary amino acid in collagen.

Why Glycine Matters for Longevity:

→ Glycine restriction mimics methionine restriction—both extend lifespan
→ Modern diets are glycine-deficient (we eat muscle meat, not skin/bones)
→ Needed for glutathione synthesis (master antioxidant)
→ Essential for collagen production
→ Required for creatine synthesis
→ Important for bile acid conjugation

Key Benefits:

😴 Sleep quality (3g before bed improves deep sleep)
🧬 Glutathione production
🦴 Joint and connective tissue health
✨ Skin health
🧠 Neuroprotection (inhibitory neurotransmitter)
🔥 Anti-inflammatory
💪 Muscle support
❤️ Cardiovascular protection

The Collagen Connection:

Collagen is 33% glycine. Collagen peptides provide glycine plus proline and hydroxyproline for connective tissue support.

Sources:
→ Bone broth (richest food source)
→ Collagen supplements
→ Pure glycine (3-5g before bed)
