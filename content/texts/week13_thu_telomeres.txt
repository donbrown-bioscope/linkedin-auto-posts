📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: TELOMERE BIOLOGY

Every time your cells divide, your telomeres shorten. When they get too short, cells stop dividing or die. This is the cellular clock of aging.

Telomeres are protective caps at the ends of chromosomes—like the plastic tips on shoelaces. They prevent DNA from unraveling and fusing with other chromosomes.

Telomere Length Across Life:

📏 At Birth: ~10,000 base pairs
📏 Age 35: ~7,500 base pairs
📏 Age 65: ~4,800 base pairs

When telomeres become critically short (~5,000 bp), cells enter senescence or die. This limits tissue regeneration and drives aging.

What Accelerates Shortening:

⚠️ Chronic psychological stress
⚠️ Poor sleep quality
⚠️ Smoking
⚠️ Obesity
⚠️ Sedentary lifestyle
⚠️ Chronic inflammation
⚠️ Oxidative stress

What Protects or Lengthens Telomeres:

✅ Aerobic exercise (strongest evidence)
✅ Meditation and stress reduction
✅ Quality sleep
✅ Mediterranean diet
✅ HBOT (shown to lengthen in clinical trial)
✅ Telomerase activators (TA-65, astragalus)

The Measurement:

Telomere length testing is available commercially. Your result is compared to age-matched averages. Having shorter telomeres than your age predicts increased disease risk and mortality.

But remember: telomeres are modifiable. Lifestyle interventions can slow shortening and potentially lengthen them.
