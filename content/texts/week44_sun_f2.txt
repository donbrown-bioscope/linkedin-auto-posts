🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: F2

The clotting factor gene. F2 G20210A mutation increases blood clot risk 3-5x. Critical to know before surgery, pregnancy, or hormone therapy.

F2 G20210A Mutation:

✅ G/G (Normal) - 97-98% of population
• Normal prothrombin levels
• Baseline clotting risk

⚠️ G/A or A/A (Mutation) - 2-3% of Caucasians
• 30% higher prothrombin
• 3-5x DVT/PE risk
• Higher risk with estrogen
• Higher risk with surgery

Who Should Be Tested:

→ Personal history of DVT/PE
→ Family history of blood clots
→ Recurrent pregnancy loss
→ Before estrogen therapy (OCPs, HRT)
→ Before major surgery
→ Unprovoked clot at young age

Often tested alongside Factor V Leiden.

Clinical Implications:

May require:
→ Anticoagulation in high-risk situations
→ Extended prophylaxis after surgery
→ Alternative contraception methods
→ Closer monitoring during pregnancy
