🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: SIRT1

The caloric restriction mimetic. SIRT1 activation mimics the benefits of fasting—potentially extending healthspan and lifespan.

What SIRT1 Does:

SIRT1 is a NAD+-dependent deacetylase that regulates:
→ Metabolism
→ Stress resistance
→ Aging

Activated by caloric restriction and fasting.

SIRT1 deacetylates p53, PGC-1α, FOXO, and NF-κB—regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, inflammation, and cell survival.

The "master regulator" of longevity pathways.

Benefits:

⏳ Longevity
🔋 Mitochondria
♻️ Autophagy
🍬 Glucose control
🔥 Anti-inflammatory
🧠 Neuroprotection
❤️ Cardioprotection
🧬 DNA repair

How to Activate SIRT1:

🔬 Fasting/caloric restriction
🔬 Resveratrol
🔬 NAD+ precursors (NMN, NR)
🔬 Exercise
🔬 Cold exposure

SIRT1 requires NAD+—boost NAD+ to boost SIRT1 activity.
