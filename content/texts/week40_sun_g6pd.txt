🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: G6PD

The most common enzyme deficiency worldwide. G6PD deficiency can cause sudden hemolytic anemia triggered by certain foods, drugs, and infections.

Why G6PD Matters:

G6PD protects red blood cells from oxidative damage by producing NADPH.

Without it, RBCs are destroyed when exposed to oxidative stressors.

X-linked inheritance:
→ Males fully affected
→ Females can be carriers or variably affected

⚠️ Hemolysis Triggers to AVOID:

🚫 Fava beans (favism)
🚫 Sulfa drugs
🚫 Primaquine (malaria drug)
🚫 Dapsone
🚫 Nitrofurantoin
🚫 Methylene blue
🚫 Rasburicase
🚫 High-dose Vitamin C
🚫 Naphthalene (mothballs)

Global Prevalence:

🌍 400+ million people affected worldwide
🌍 Most common in:
→ Mediterranean populations
→ African descent
→ Middle Eastern
→ Southeast Asian

Evolved as malaria protection.

Always screen before prescribing trigger medications, especially in at-risk populations.
