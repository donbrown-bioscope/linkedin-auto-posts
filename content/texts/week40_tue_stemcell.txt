💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: STEM CELL THERAPY

The frontier of regenerative medicine. Stem cells can regenerate damaged tissues, modulate inflammation, and potentially reverse disease.

Types of Stem Cells:

🧬 MSCs (Mesenchymal Stem Cells)
From bone marrow, fat, or umbilical cord. Anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory. Most common type used.

🩸 HSCs (Hematopoietic Stem Cells)
From bone marrow or cord blood. Rebuild blood and immune system.

🔬 iPSCs (Induced Pluripotent)
Reprogrammed adult cells. Can become any cell type.

🧫 Exosomes
Stem cell-derived vesicles. Carry regenerative signals.

Current Applications:

→ Orthopedic (joints, tendons)
→ Autoimmune conditions
→ Cardiac regeneration
→ Neurological conditions
→ Anti-aging protocols
→ Wound healing
→ Hair restoration
→ Lung disease

⚠️ Important Cautions:

→ Many clinics offer unproven treatments
→ FDA-approved uses are limited
→ Seek accredited centers with published outcomes
→ Consider clinical trials for cutting-edge applications
→ Quality and sourcing vary widely
