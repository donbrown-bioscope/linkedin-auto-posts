🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: GSTM1/GSTT1

Critical Phase II detox enzymes. 50% of people have GSTM1 deletion. 20% have GSTT1 deletion. These are complete gene deletions—not SNPs—meaning no enzyme activity.

Glutathione S-Transferases conjugate glutathione to toxins, making them water-soluble for excretion. They're essential for detoxifying carcinogens, drugs, and environmental chemicals.

GSTM1 Null (Deletion):

→ 50% of Caucasians
→ 50% of Asians
→ 27% of African Americans
→ Complete loss of GSTM1 enzyme function

GSTT1 Null (Deletion):

→ 20% of Caucasians
→ 50% of Asians
→ 22% of African Americans
→ No theta-class GST activity

Double Null Implications:

Having both genes deleted significantly impairs glutathione conjugation of:
→ Pesticides and herbicides
→ Carcinogens (benzene, PAHs, aflatoxins)
→ Heavy metals
→ Drug metabolites
→ Environmental pollutants

Clinical Recommendations for Null Genotypes:

✅ Extra glutathione support (liposomal glutathione, NAC)
✅ Cruciferous vegetables (induce other GSTs)
✅ Minimize environmental toxin exposure
✅ Support alternative detox pathways
✅ Sulforaphane supplementation
✅ Regular sauna/sweating

These individuals may have higher cancer risk from environmental exposures—but knowledge enables prevention.
