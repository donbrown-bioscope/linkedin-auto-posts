🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: ALDH2

The "Asian Flush" gene. 540 million people carry a variant that turns alcohol into a carcinogen—and most don't know it.

ALDH2 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2) breaks down acetaldehyde, the toxic first byproduct of alcohol metabolism.

The Variants:

✓ ALDH2*1/*1 (Normal)
→ Efficient acetaldehyde clearance
→ Normal alcohol metabolism
→ Standard cancer risk from drinking

🚨 ALDH2*2 Carriers (Deficient) — 40% of East Asians
→ Acetaldehyde accumulates (toxic!)
→ Facial flushing, nausea, rapid heartbeat
→ 6-10x esophageal cancer risk with alcohol
→ Higher risk of Alzheimer's, osteoporosis

The Critical Warning:

If you flush when drinking, your body is telling you something important.

Acetaldehyde is a Group 1 carcinogen—same category as asbestos and plutonium.

ALDH2*2 carriers who drink heavily have up to 89x increased esophageal cancer risk.

The flush is NOT "building tolerance." It's toxicity accumulating.

What to do if you carry ALDH2*2:

→ Ideally, avoid alcohol entirely
→ If drinking, keep it minimal
→ Never "push through" the flush
→ Be aware of increased disease risks
→ Consider more aggressive screening

Knowing your status could literally save your life.
