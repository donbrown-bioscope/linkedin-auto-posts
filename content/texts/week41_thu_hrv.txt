📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV)

The window into your nervous system. HRV measures beat-to-beat variation—higher is better and indicates resilience, recovery, and longevity.

What Is HRV?

HRV measures the variation in time between heartbeats. Unlike heart rate (BPM), HRV reflects the balance between:
→ Sympathetic (fight/flight)
→ Parasympathetic (rest/digest)

Higher HRV = more adaptable, resilient system
Low HRV predicts mortality and disease

Key Metrics:

📊 RMSSD - Most common, parasympathetic activity
📊 SDNN - Overall autonomic function
📊 HF Power - Vagal tone indicator
📊 LF/HF Ratio - Sympathetic/parasympathetic balance
📊 Morning HRV - Best for recovery tracking

How to Improve HRV:

😴 Quality sleep
🏃 Exercise (avoid overtraining)
🧘 Stress management
🌬️ Breathwork
🥶 Cold exposure
🍷 Limit alcohol
🥗 Optimize nutrition

Devices: WHOOP, Oura, Apple Watch, Garmin
