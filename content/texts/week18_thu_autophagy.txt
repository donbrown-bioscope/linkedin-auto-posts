📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: AUTOPHAGY

Your cells have a built-in recycling system. It breaks down damaged proteins and organelles, turning cellular trash into building blocks. This declines with age.

Autophagy ("self-eating") won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Medicine. It's fundamental to cellular health and longevity.

The Autophagy Process:

1️⃣ Damaged component tagged for removal
2️⃣ Autophagosome (double membrane) forms around it
3️⃣ Fuses with lysosome (acid-filled organelle)
4️⃣ Contents degraded by enzymes
5️⃣ Building blocks (amino acids, etc.) recycled

What Activates Autophagy:

✅ Fasting (16+ hours significant activation)
✅ Exercise (especially endurance)
✅ Caloric restriction
✅ Spermidine
✅ Resveratrol
✅ Rapamycin
✅ Coffee (polyphenols)

What Inhibits Autophagy:

⚠️ Constant eating/snacking
⚠️ High insulin states
⚠️ Excess protein (activates mTOR)
⚠️ Aging itself
⚠️ Chronic inflammation
⚠️ Sleep deprivation

Why It Matters:

Declining autophagy contributes to:
→ Neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's)
→ Cancer (damaged cells not cleared)
→ Aging
→ Immune dysfunction
→ Metabolic disease

Enhancing autophagy may be one of the most powerful interventions for healthy aging. Time-restricted eating alone activates it daily.
