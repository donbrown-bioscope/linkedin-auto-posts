🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: SLC6A4

The "serotonin reuptake" gene. SLC6A4 determines how fast serotonin is cleared from synapses—affecting mood, anxiety, stress resilience, and SSRI response.

SLC6A4 encodes the serotonin transporter (5-HTT), the target of SSRI antidepressants like Prozac and Zoloft.

5-HTTLPR Polymorphism:

Long (L) Allele:
✅ Higher serotonin transporter expression
✅ Faster serotonin reuptake
✅ More stress resilience
✅ Lower anxiety/depression risk
✅ Better SSRI response

Short (S) Allele:
⚠️ Lower transporter expression
⚠️ Slower serotonin reuptake
⚠️ Higher stress sensitivity
⚠️ Increased anxiety/depression risk
⚠️ Variable SSRI response
⚠️ More environmental sensitivity ("orchid gene")

Pharmacogenomic Implications:

→ S/S genotype may need different antidepressants or higher SSRI doses
→ L/L typically responds well to standard SSRI therapy
→ S carriers may benefit more from SNRIs or other classes

The S allele isn't "bad"—it's associated with increased environmental sensitivity, meaning both more vulnerability to adversity AND more responsiveness to positive environments.
