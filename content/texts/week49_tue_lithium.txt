💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: LITHIUM (MICRODOSE)

The brain protector. At trace doses, lithium is neuroprotective and potentially life-extending—far below psychiatric doses.

How Microdose Lithium Works:

Lithium inhibits GSK-3β, promoting:
→ Neuroplasticity
→ BDNF expression
→ Autophagy

Epidemiological studies show areas with higher lithium in drinking water have:
→ Lower dementia rates
→ Lower suicide rates
→ Lower all-cause mortality

Microdoses (1-20mg) provide benefits without side effects of therapeutic doses (300-1200mg).

Benefits:

🧠 Neuroprotection
🔄 Neuroplasticity
😊 Mood stability
⏳ Longevity
🛡️ Anti-Alzheimer's
🧬 Telomere protection
🔥 Anti-inflammatory
♻️ Autophagy

Dosing:

💊 Forms: Lithium orotate, lithium aspartate
💊 Dose: 1-20mg elemental lithium daily
💊 No monitoring needed at these doses
