💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: LOW-DOSE NALTREXONE (LDN)

The immune rebalancer. At low doses, naltrexone modulates immunity and reduces inflammation—used off-label for autoimmune, chronic pain, and more.

How LDN Works:

At low doses (1.5-4.5mg), naltrexone briefly blocks opioid receptors, triggering a rebound increase in:
→ Endorphins
→ Enkephalins

This modulates immune function, reduces inflammation via TLR4 blockade, and may reduce microglial activation.

Very different from full-dose (50mg) addiction treatment.
