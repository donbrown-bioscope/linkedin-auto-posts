🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: CFTR

The chloride channel gene. CFTR mutations cause cystic fibrosis—1 in 25 Caucasians are carriers. Knowing carrier status enables family planning.

What CFTR Does:

CFTR encodes a chloride channel that regulates salt and water balance in epithelial tissues.

Mutations cause thick, sticky mucus in:
→ Lungs
→ Pancreas
→ Digestive tract
→ Reproductive organs

ΔF508 is the most common mutation (70% of CF alleles). Over 2,000 CFTR mutations identified.

Carrier Screening Matters:

Carriers (one mutated copy) are healthy.

If BOTH parents are carriers:
→ 25% chance of affected child

Carrier frequency:
→ 1 in 25 Caucasians
→ 1 in 46 Hispanic Americans
→ 1 in 65 African Americans

Preconception screening recommended.

Treatment Revolution:

🎯 CFTR modulators (Trikafta) now dramatically improve outcomes for ~90% of CF patients
🧬 Gene therapy in clinical trials
