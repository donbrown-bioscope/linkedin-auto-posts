🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: PCSK9

Some people are born with LDL so low they're nearly immune to heart disease. They have loss-of-function PCSK9 mutations. Now we can mimic this with drugs.

PCSK9 controls how many LDL receptors are on liver cells. More receptors = more LDL cleared from blood = lower LDL levels.

How PCSK9 Controls Your LDL:

1️⃣ LDL receptor grabs LDL from blood
2️⃣ PCSK9 tags the receptor for destruction
3️⃣ Fewer receptors = higher LDL

If you block PCSK9, receptors survive longer, and LDL drops dramatically.

The Genetic Variants:

✓ Loss-of-Function (Protective)
3% of African Americans carry these variants. Their LDL is 30-40% lower lifelong. They have 88% lower heart disease risk. No apparent health downsides.

🚨 Gain-of-Function (Harmful)
Causes familial hypercholesterolemia. Very high LDL from birth. Heart attacks in 30s-40s without treatment.

PCSK9 Inhibitor Drugs:

💉 Evolocumab (Repatha)
💉 Alirocumab (Praluent)
Injectable antibodies that block PCSK9. Lower LDL by 50-60% on top of statins. Given every 2-4 weeks.

💉 Inclisiran
siRNA that silences PCSK9 gene. Only needs to be given twice per year. Recently approved.

Who Benefits Most:

→ Statin-intolerant patients
→ Familial hypercholesterolemia
→ Very high cardiovascular risk despite statins
→ Recurrent events on max therapy

The lesson: Genetic "experiments of nature" showed us PCSK9 inhibition is safe and profoundly protective. Then we made drugs to mimic it.
