📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING

Consumer DNA tests check ~0.1% of your genome. WGS reads all 3 billion base pairs—every gene, every variant, complete.

The Comparison:

📊 23andMe / Ancestry
~700,000 SNPs tested (0.02% of genome)
Pre-selected variants only
Miss rare and novel mutations
Can't be updated with new discoveries

🧬 Whole Genome Sequencing
3+ billion base pairs read (100% of genome)
Every gene, every variant
Captures rare mutations
Can be reanalyzed as science advances

What WGS Reveals:

💊 Pharmacogenomics — How you metabolize drugs
🎗️ Cancer risk genes — BRCA, Lynch syndrome, and beyond
❤️ Cardiac variants — Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias
🧬 Rare diseases — Often missed by standard testing
👶 Carrier status — For family planning
🧠 Neurological risk — Including rare variants
🔮 Future discoveries — Your data grows more valuable over time
📈 Polygenic risk scores — Combined effects of thousands of variants

The Economics:

The first human genome cost $3 billion (2003).

Today: ~$200-400 for WGS.

Once sequenced, your data can be reanalyzed for decades as new disease associations are discovered. It's a one-time investment with compounding returns.

The catch: Interpretation is everything. Raw data without expert analysis is just noise. You need AI-powered systems that can make sense of 3 billion data points.

👨‍⚕️ Physicians: Why aren't you using Bioscope.AI to offer true AI-powered precision medicine?

🧑 Patients: Why isn't your physician using Bioscope.AI to maximize your healthy longevity?
