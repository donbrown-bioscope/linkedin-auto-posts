💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: EXOSOMES

For years, we thought stem cells worked by becoming new tissue.

Turns out, they work mostly by what they secrete.

Enter exosomes: the cell's messenger system.

What are exosomes?

Nano-sized vesicles (30-150nm) released by cells, carrying:
🧬 mRNA — genetic instructions
🔗 miRNA — gene regulators
⚙️ Proteins — signaling molecules
📦 Growth factors — repair signals

Think of them as "biological FedEx packages" delivering regenerative instructions from cell to cell.

Why exosomes instead of stem cells?

✓ No live cells = no rejection risk
✓ Can be standardized and quality-controlled
✓ Cross blood-brain barrier (stem cells can't)
✓ Stable storage and transport
✓ Scalable production

Current applications:

🦴 Orthopedic — Joint repair, cartilage regeneration
✨ Aesthetic — Skin rejuvenation, hair restoration
🧠 Neurological — Brain injury, neurodegeneration research
❤️ Cardiac — Post-MI recovery studies

The paradigm shift:

Traditional approach: Replace damaged cells
Exosome approach: Instruct existing cells to repair themselves

We're moving from transplanting cells to reprogramming the cells you already have.

⚠️ Important caveat: Quality and sourcing vary enormously. Work only with verified, characterized products from reputable sources.
