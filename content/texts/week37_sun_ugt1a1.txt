🧬 GENE OF THE WEEK: UGT1A1

The bilirubin conjugation gene. UGT1A1 variants cause Gilbert's syndrome (benign jaundice) and affect metabolism of key chemotherapy and HIV drugs.

UGT1A1 encodes an enzyme that conjugates bilirubin for excretion and metabolizes certain drugs.

UGT1A1*28 Polymorphism:

*1/*1 (Normal):
✅ Normal enzyme activity
✅ Standard bilirubin levels
✅ Normal drug metabolism
✅ Standard irinotecan dosing

*28/*28 (Gilbert's Syndrome):
⚠️ ~70% reduced enzyme activity
⚠️ Elevated bilirubin (usually harmless)
⚠️ Irinotecan toxicity risk
⚠️ Dose reduction required
⚠️ Affects atazanavir levels

Key Drugs Affected:

💊 Irinotecan (chemotherapy)
💊 Atazanavir (HIV medication)
💊 Belinostat
💊 Sacituzumab govitecan

Gilbert's syndrome affects 5-10% of population. Usually benign with intermittent mild jaundice, but becomes clinically important when these drugs are prescribed.
