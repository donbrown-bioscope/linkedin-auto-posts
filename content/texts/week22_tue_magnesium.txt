💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: MAGNESIUM OPTIMIZATION

Involved in 300+ enzymatic reactions. 50% of Americans are deficient. Serum magnesium is a poor marker—only 1% of body stores are in blood.

Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and a cofactor for ATP production, DNA synthesis, nerve function, muscle contraction, and more.

Magnesium Forms & Best Uses:

💊 Mg Glycinate: Best absorbed, calming, sleep. Won't cause GI issues. Best all-around choice.

🧠 Mg Threonate: Crosses blood-brain barrier. Best for cognition, memory, neurological support.

❤️ Mg Taurate: Heart health, blood pressure, arrhythmias. Taurine adds cardioprotection.

⚡ Mg Malate: Energy, muscle pain, fibromyalgia. Malic acid supports ATP production.

💧 Mg Citrate: Good absorption, cost-effective. Can have laxative effect at higher doses.

❌ Mg Oxide: Avoid. Only 4% absorbed. Cheap filler in most supplements.

Key Functions:

→ ATP production (all energy metabolism)
→ Muscle relaxation and function
→ Nerve signaling
→ Sleep quality
→ Heart rhythm stability
→ Bone health
→ DNA repair
→ Blood sugar regulation

Dosing: 200-400mg elemental magnesium daily. RBC magnesium is a better test than serum.
