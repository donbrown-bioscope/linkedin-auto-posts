📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: CORONARY ARTERY CALCIUM SCORING

Your cholesterol is "fine." Your stress test was normal.

But do you have plaque in your arteries RIGHT NOW?

Only one test tells you directly: the Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Score.

What It Measures:

A low-dose CT scan detects calcified plaque in your coronary arteries. Calcium only deposits in atherosclerotic plaque—so any calcium means disease is present.

The Scores:

0 = No detectable calcified plaque
→ Very low short-term risk
→ Reassuring, but not a free pass forever

1-99 = Mild plaque
→ Disease is present
→ Time to optimize aggressively

100-399 = Moderate plaque
→ Significant disease
→ Strong consideration for statin therapy

400+ = Extensive plaque
→ High risk
→ Aggressive intervention warranted

Why CAC Beats Risk Calculators:

The standard 10-year ASCVD risk calculator uses age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.

But it misses people with perfect numbers who have plaque—and overtreats people with "bad" numbers who are actually fine.

CAC shows you what's actually happening in YOUR arteries.

The Power of Zero:

A CAC of 0 reduces your predicted risk dramatically. Many cardiologists will defer statins in low/intermediate-risk patients with CAC = 0.

But if your CAC is elevated despite "good" cholesterol, you know intervention is needed NOW.

Cost: ~$100-200, often not covered by insurance. Worth every penny.
