💊 INTERVENTION OF THE WEEK: PRP / PRF THERAPY

Your own blood as medicine. PRP concentrates growth factors and platelets to accelerate healing in joints, tendons, skin, and hair.

How PRP Works:

Blood is drawn and centrifuged to concentrate platelets (3-5x normal).

These platelets release growth factors:
→ PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)
→ TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor)
→ VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)
→ IGF-1 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor)

Applications:

🦵 Knee osteoarthritis
💪 Tendinopathy (tennis elbow, Achilles)
👤 Hair restoration
✨ Facial rejuvenation
🦴 Bone healing
🩹 Wound healing
🎾 Sports injuries
🦷 Dental/oral surgery

PRP vs PRF:

PRP: Uses anticoagulant, faster release
PRF: Additive-free, slower sustained release, more white blood cells

Both are autologous (your own blood) = minimal rejection risk.
