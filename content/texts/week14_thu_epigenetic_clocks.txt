📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: EPIGENETIC CLOCKS

Your birthday measures time. Epigenetic clocks measure biological wear. Two 50-year-olds can have biological ages 10+ years apart.

Epigenetic clocks analyze DNA methylation patterns at specific CpG sites. These patterns change predictably with age—but lifestyle can speed up or slow down the clock.

Major Epigenetic Clocks:

⏰ Horvath Clock (2013)
First multi-tissue clock. 353 CpG sites. Highly accurate for chronological age.

⏰ Hannum Clock (2013)
Blood-based. 71 CpG sites. Good at predicting mortality.

⏰ PhenoAge (2018)
Trained on mortality + clinical markers. Better predictor of healthspan.

⏰ GrimAge (2019)
Best mortality predictor to date. Incorporates smoking history and plasma proteins.

⏰ DunedinPACE (2022)
Measures pace of aging. Shows how fast you're currently aging, not just cumulative age.

What Your Biological Age Tells You:

Chronological Age: 50
Bio Age (Accelerated): 58 ⚠️ — Aging faster, higher disease risk
Bio Age (Decelerated): 43 ✓ — Aging slower, lower disease risk

What Accelerates Biological Aging:

→ Smoking (adds years to epigenetic age)
→ Obesity
→ Poor sleep
→ Chronic stress
→ Sedentary lifestyle
→ High inflammation

What Decelerates Aging:

→ Exercise (especially consistent aerobic)
→ Caloric restriction
→ Quality sleep
→ Low inflammation
→ Healthy diet

The breakthrough: For the first time, we can measure the RATE of aging—and track whether our interventions are working.
