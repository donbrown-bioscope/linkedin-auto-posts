📊 HEALTH TOPIC OF THE WEEK: NUTRIENT STATUS TESTING

You can't optimize what you don't measure. Comprehensive nutrient testing reveals subclinical deficiencies that standard panels miss.

Key Nutrients to Test:

☀️ Vitamin D: Optimal 50-80 ng/mL
💊 B12: Optimal >500 pg/mL
🧬 Folate (RBC): Intracellular status
🔋 Magnesium (RBC): Serum Mg is useless
🩸 Iron Panel: Ferritin + TIBC + Iron
⚡ Zinc: Often deficient
🦴 Selenium: Thyroid, antioxidant
🐟 Omega-3 Index: Target 8-12%
🔋 CoQ10: Mitochondria, energy
👁️ Vitamin A: Retinol
⚖️ Copper/Zinc Ratio: Balance matters
🦋 Iodine: Thyroid function

Testing Options:

🔬 Comprehensive panels: NutrEval, ION Profile, SpectraCell
🔬 RBC minerals more accurate than serum
🔬 Organic acids show functional deficiencies
🔬 Test annually or when symptoms suggest
